The variation of second moment with correlation time has been calculated on the basis of Kubo and Tomita's formulation of motional narrowing. The extraction of correlation times from the measured second moments is described, and an example given."

   abstract = "An equation is postulated for NMR motional narrowing in solids which is based on the concept of two possible states for each ion: excited and nonexcited. The excited state corresponds to thermal activation. The equation can be obtained from the Bloch equations. It does not explicitly involve a jumping frequency or correlation time, and it is shown that results calculated using the equation should not be distorted by a distribution of correlation times. The derivation of the equation does not require knowledge of an autocorrelation factor or of the frequency spectrum of microscopically varying local fields. It provides a relation for NMR line width vs temperature which reduces to the Redfield equation in the extreme high-temperature range, but which also yields apparently meaningful results throughout the entire temperature range of motional narrowing. The utility of the equation in handling experimental data is demonstrated with examples of motional narrowing in crystals and glasses. The results provide a guideline for determining the nature of the motion (long-range or short-range) causing narrowing of the NMR line. Comparisons are made with other methods for analyzing motional narrowing data."

   abstract = "Lithium diffusion in amorphous LiNbO3, synthesized by a sol–gel process, was investigated by temperature- and frequency-dependent 7Li NMR experiments. 7Li spin-lattice relaxation rates T−11 and 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, in particular line shapes and motional narrowing of the central line, were measured. The results are discussed in comparison with those on nano- and microcrystalline LiNbO3 investigated by us earlier. The Li diffusivity in the amorphous material is much higher than in the microcrystalline one and can be described by practically the same diffusion parameters as in nanocrystalline LiNbO3. This suggests that the diffusion pathways in amorphous LiNbO3 and in the interfacial regions of nanocrystalline LiNbO3 have similar structures."

A corresponding formula, which can be used for fitting the two-step temperature dependencies of the NMR line width, has been deduced. We also considered the case of a distribution of correlation times and deduced a corresponding analytical fitting function. Elaborated expressions have been applied to the NMR line width analysis of LiNaSO4 in the temperature range 295–788K."
