   abstract = "The applicability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy continues to expand in physics, chemistry, material science, geology, biology, and medicine. An increasing range of NMR techniques is employed for either spectroscopic studies or imaging purposes, most becoming possible because of the high magnetic fields of superconducting magnets (almost an order of magnitude higher than ordinary iron magnets), and the availability of fast computers for controlling purposes and final data processing. These improvements together with the realization of fast mechanical sample spinning and new pulse techniques have led to high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the perturbing effect of the electric quadrupole interaction becomes less important at higher magnetic fields, the investigation of powder samples with NMR techniques has become more feasible. As a result, the number of publications concerning NMR studies of quadrupole nuclei in powder samples rapidly increased in the eighties. However, since 1987 this number of publications is rather stable and amounts to about 100 per year.",
