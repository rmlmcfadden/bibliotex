The 1/T law of Heitler and Teller, which is imposed by the statistics of the electrons, is obtained by using the Bloch approximation of metals. An approximate relation is derived between the relaxation time τ and the relative line shift ΔH/H, viz. τ(ΔHH)2 = ℏπkTg2 where g is the nuclear g-factor in Bohr-units. The experimental results on 7Li, 27Al and 63Cu are discussed with special reference to the influence of the correlation between the electrons. The deviations from the 1/T law for Li are all or nearly all attributed to the influence of paramagnetic impurities."

   abstract = "General theoretical expressions are derived for the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in crystalline solids arising from the interaction of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment with the crystalline electric field. The importance of shielding, antishielding and co-valent effects for the quadrupolar spin-lattice coupling is discussed, and the complete temperature dependence of the transition probability P for a nuclear spin making a transition as a result of the thermal Raman processes is determined on the basis of some simplifying assumptions about the nature of the lattice vibrations. At low temperatures the P are developed in ascending powers of the temperature T, the first term being proportional to T7. It is found that this power series is rapidly convergent only for T smaller than about 0.02Θ, where Θ is the Debije temperature. At high temperatures, the P are developed in descending powers of T, and it is found that an expression of the form T2(a − b/T2) gives a good representation of the temperature dependence of P down to about T = ½Θ. General expressions are derived for the dependence of the probabilities P on the direction of the external magnetic field relative to the crystal axes. Finally, a simple, one-parameter model is discussed, in which the crystalline field at a nucleus is assumed to arise from a number of equal point charges placed on the nearest neighboring lattice sites. The magnitude q of these charges is a measure for the quadrupolar spin-lattice coupling, and is the adjustable parameter of the model. Detailed calculations are made with this model for crystals of the NaCl-type. The calculated relaxation times 1/P are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones for values of q of the order of 102 − 103e, where e is the electronic charge. The significance of this result is discussed. Finally, the dependence on the direction of the external field is calculated, and the probability for a transition Δm = ± 1 for the (111) direction is found to be about 50\% larger than for the (100) direction, while the probability for a transition Δm = ± 2 for the (111) direction is about 10\% smaller than for the (100) direction."

   abstract = {A general procedure is given for finding the equation of motion of the density matrix of a system in contact with a thermal bath, as for example a nuclear spin system weakly coupled to a crystal lattice. The thermal bath is treated both classically and quantum mechanically, and the theory is similar to, and a generalization of, conventional theories of time proportional transition probabilities. Relaxation of the system by the thermal bath is expressed by a linear matrix operator, and it is stressed that elements of this operator can be regarded as secular or nonsecular perturbations on the equation of motion and can be treated accordingly. When the motion of the system is slow compared to that of the thermal bath, the equation of motion can be expressed in an operator form which is independent of representation. If the system has a time-dependent Hamiltonian which varies slowly compared to the motion of the thermal bath, the same equation of motion is obeyed and the system is relaxed by the bath toward a Boltzmann distribution with respect to its instantaneous Hamiltonian. If the time variation of the Hamiltonian is more rapid, higher order corrections to the equation of motion must be applied. The theory is applied to spin-lattice relaxation of a coupled nuclear spin system in a metal, for arbitrary externally applied fixed magnetic field.},

  abstract = {An examination is made of the spin-lattice relaxation in the solid state of nuclei whose energy level spacings in a magnetic field are rendered unequal by quadrupole interactions with the crystalline electric field. Attention is directed to two special cases: (1) when the main magnetic field is suddenly increased from zero, and (2) after saturation of the central line of the resonance spectrum; in the case of imperfect cubic crystals this is the only observed line. In general, 2 I relaxation times characterize the relaxation behaviour, though in the two special cases the effective number is reduced. Detailed calculations of the relaxation behaviour have been made for spin number fraction three-twos and fraction five-twos for a quadrupolar relaxation mechanism. The behaviour in the two special cases differs and to a degree which depends on the relative strength of quadrupolar relaxation by transitions involving Δm = 1 and 2. The relevance of the results to the experiments of Day and Squire on potassium iodide is discussed. Magnetic relaxation is also treated and an expression is found for the 2 I relaxation times.}

In particular, the types of distribution determined experimentally from dielectric studies are used to provide the basis for a correlation between dielectric and nuclear resonance measurements. It appears possible to remove partially the discrepancy between the activation energies describing the temperature dependence of the mean correlation time as determined by the two methods. A procedure, independent of the type of distribution present, for determining this activation energy is suggested. T1 measurements on polyethylene glycol 200, polyoxymethylene and glycerol are interpreted on the basis of the expressions developed, activation parameters being calculated where possible."

It is shown that the low-frequency form of J (p) ( omega ) is J (p) (0)-A 3 omega 1/2 in liquids and crystals, A 2 ln omega -1 in two-dimensional systems and A 1 omega -1/2 in one-dimensional systems and expressions for the coefficients A 1 , A 2 and A 3 are derived which are valid for any diffusive model whose long-range, long-time behaviour may be described by the diffusion equation. The high-frequency form of J (p) ( omega ) is derived for a simple-hopping model of spins on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices and in each case J (p) ( omega ) is of the form B omega -2 . Expressions are derived for the coefficient B, for each dimension, which correctly include the effect of correlations between the hops of the spins.}

This is preceded by a brief review of nuclear spin relaxation in solids which includes a discussion of the appropriate spin-dependent interactions and the various relaxation rates which can be measured. Also, the link between nuclear spin relaxation and dielectric relaxation is discussed. Where possible and/or appropriate each of the spectral densities is expressed as a continuous distribution of Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound (or Debye) spectral densities 2ξ /(1 + ξ2 ω2) for nuclear Larmor angular frequency ω and correlation time ξ. The spectral densities are named after their originators or the shape of the distributions of correlation times or both and are (1) Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound or δ-function, (2) Havriliak-Negami, (3) Cole-Cole, (4) Davidson-Cole, (5) Fang, (6) Fuoss-Kirkwood, (7) Bryn Mawr, (8) Wagner or log-Gaussian, (9) log-Lorentzian, and (10) Fröhlich or energy box. The Havriliak-Negami spectral density is related to the Dissado-Hill theory for dielectric relaxation. The spectral densities are expressed in a way which makes them easy to compare with each other and with experimental data. Many plots of the distributions of correlation times and of the spectral densities vs. various correlation times characterizing the distributions are given."

The whole dynamical range from immobile to rapidly diffusing probes is covered. In contrast to what was done in earlier work, the dipole-dipole interaction between probe and host is taken into account quantitatively. For the static case and the limiting case of rapid diffusion, respectively, well known expressions both for static linewidth as well as for relaxation rates are rederived. The results are compared with the theory of Kubo and Tomita (1954), where the local fields are treated only phenomenologically.}

A general expression for the dynamics of the spin polarization is derived in the Laplace domain. For rapid transitions between both frequencies a spin precession with the average frequency 12(ω1+ω2) is found, which is damped in accordance with motional narrowing. An average of the results over Gaussian distributions of the rotation frequencies ω1 and ω2 is also performed. For large transition rates the result of the static Kubo-Toyabe theory is recovered."

   abstract = "Spin-lattice relaxation in solids often deviates from the usual exponential law, for example, in dilute spin-12 solids like silicon carbide, when relaxation arises from fixed paramagnetic impurities. We examine nonexponential spin-lattice relaxation from the point of view of nonlinear regression to the stretched-exponential function M(τ) = a − bexp[−(τ/T′)n], where n is typically 1 or 0.5 but can have intermediate values. Criteria for error estimation as well as an optimal choice of delay times τ are examined in detail and tested on typical data from our studies on silicon carbide. Two methods are outlined for the estimation of confidence intervals which are typically found to be somewhat larger than the standard errors in the parameters. The typical experiment for determination of spin-lattice relaxation time is found to be robust even when relaxation is nonexponential. The determinant of the curvature matrix is a good experimental design criterion and correlates well with the estimated errors. While any reasonable choice of points yields good results, an optimal choice of delay times τ can be made by following the guidelines presented here."

We treat the general situation in which both magnetic and quadrupolar fluctuations are present and consider three cases differing in their initial conditions: (1) a short radio-frequency pulse is applied selectively to one of the transitions; (2) all lines are saturated at once; (3) a selected line is saturated by continuous waves or by means of a long comb of pulses. Exact solutions are presented for spin I = 1 and I = 3/2, whereas for spin I = 5/2, exact solutions are given for special cases and approximate solutions for the general case. The spin I = 7/2 case is treated for magnetic fluctuations only. The detailed analysis reveals that the form of the recovery law is surprisingly insensitive to an additional relaxation channel, e.g. quadrupolar fluctuations in the presence of predominantly magnetic fluctuations or vice versa.}

   abstract = "The universal features of polymer dynamics are specifically represented by laws for (anomalous) segment diffusion and chain relaxation modes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based techniques provide direct access to these phenomena. This in particular refers to NMR relaxation and diffusion studies. Methods suitable for this purpose are described in detail. Three basic classes of polymer dynamics models, namely the Rouse model, the tube/reptation model, and the renormalized Rouse models are outlined and discussed with respect to predictions for NMR measurands. A wealth of experimental NMR data are reviewed and compared with predictions of the model theories. It is shown that characteristic features of all three types of models can be verified in great detail provided that the model premisses are suitably mimicked in the experiments. Rouse dynamics is shown to be relevant for polymer melts with molecular weights below the critical value and for solutions of diminished entanglement effect. Features specific for the renormalized Rouse model reveal themselves in the form of high- and low-mode-number limits of the spin--lattice relaxation dispersion. These results are considered to mirror the analytical structure of the Generalized Langevin Equation. Finally, anomalous-diffusion and relaxation laws characteristic for the tube/reptation model can be perfectly reproduced in experiment if the polymer chains are confined in a nanoporous, solid matrix whereas bulk melts are not in accord with these predictions. The dynamics of chains confined in artificial tubes can be treated analytically assuming a harmonic radial potential for the polymer/wall interaction. These results derived for a real tube closely render the characteristic features of the original Doi/Edwards model predicted for a fictitious tube.",
