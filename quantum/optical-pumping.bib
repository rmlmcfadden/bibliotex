   abstract = {The interaction between the nucleus and the electrons and its effects on atomic spectra are first recalled and the relevance of the parameters deduced from these hyperfine effects to nuclear structure is emphasised. Special attention is paid to effects which are now observable in long isotopic chains. The production and handling of these radioactive atoms is studied in some detail, including the production of nuclei far from stability by means of nuclear reactions with particle beams coming from accelerators, and the use of on-line isotope separators. The experimental methods of radiofrequency are explained at an introductory level with the different means of producing and detecting nuclear orientation, some of which are specific to radioactive atoms, being described. Methods of optical hyperfine spectroscopy are reviewed and the dramatic increase in sensitivity offered by the use of tunable lasers and by new methods of non-optical detection of optical resonances is explained. Finally, an account is given of the main results obtained in three cases: light alkalis, heavy alkalis and mercury. These results are interpreted in terms of nuclear structure.}

Before the tunable narrow-band lasers led to the invention of Doppler-free techniques, spectral lines from cooled hollow-cathode discharges(1) had typical widths larger than 300 MHz, and high resolution was achieved only in rf spectroscopy, e.g., within hyperfine structure multiplets, by the classical techniques like atomic beam magnetic resonance,(2) optical pum$\rho$ing,(3) or double resonance.(4) While the Doppler broadening(1){\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\{}v{\_}D{\}} = {\{}v{\_}0{\}}{\{}{\backslash}left( {\{}{\{}{\{}8kT{\{}{\backslash}rm{\{} {\}}{\}}{\backslash}ln {\{}{\backslash}rm{\{} 2{\}}{\}}{\}} {\backslash}over {\{}m{\{}c^2{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right)^{\{}1/2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}is negligible for resonance frequencies v0 in the rf regime, the narrowing of optical resonances by cooling to low temperatures, T, has obvious limits. On the other hand, Eq. (1) holds for an isotropic thermal velocity distribution, and a narrow Doppler width requires a reduction in the spread of velocity components only along the direction of observation. It is well known from ion optics that this can be achieved by electrostatic acceleration.",

   abstract = {By numerically solving the density matrix equations, we show that the laser frequency ramping method by means of position-dependent Zeeman splitting can efficiently polarize nuclear spin of atoms/ions in an accelerator beamline. This minimizes a quantum phenomenon, coherent population trapping, which limits the optical pumping efficiency in the polarized beamline for radioactive nuclear spin polarization. We consider the Li8 atomic system interacting with two circularly polarized laser beams in the presence of time-dependent magnetic field. From numerical results, we find that optimum frequency ramping allows efficient optical pumping for a short interaction time, e.g., 2\&\#xA0;\&\#x3BC;s.},
