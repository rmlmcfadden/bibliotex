   abstract = "The mass magnetic susceptibility (χ) of polycrystalline samples of Ag and Au has been determined in the range 6–300°K by a high-precision Faraday method. Samples with purities ranging to 6N have been measured. It is shown that the observed temperature dependence of χ for the 1B metals in the range 6–1000°K can be explained in terms of the change in the density of states at the Fermi level produced as a result of the change in the lattice parameter."

The resonance is attributed to conduction electrons in particles where the electron-phonon interaction is severely inhibited. The mean g-value is 2.26 ± 0.02 and the mean line width 200 G. A variation of line width with temperature has been observed and is explained tentatively in terms of the discreteness of the electron energy levels.},

They have in common an incompletely filled 4d (Au, Pd) or 5d-band (Au, Pt), that gives rise partially to this type of magnetism. By means of Xray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) at the L2,3 edges the orbital and spin contributions to the magnetic moment stemming from the d-band has been explored. The different magnetic response of these metals, as viewed with XMCD, is revised.}
