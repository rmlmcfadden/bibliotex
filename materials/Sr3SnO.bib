   abstract = {A large variety of perovskite oxide superconductors are known, including some of the most prominent high-temperature and unconventional superconductors. However, superconductivity among the oxidation state inverted material class, the antiperovskite oxides, was recently reported for the first time. In this superconductor, Sr3−xSnO, the unconventional ionic state Sn4− is realized and possible unconventional superconductivity due to a band inversion has been discussed. Here, we discuss an improved facile synthesis method, making it possible to control the strontium deficiency in Sr3−xSnO. Additionally, a synthesis method above the melting point of Sr3SnO is presented. We show temperature dependence of magnetization and electrical resistivity for superconducting strontium deficient Sr3−xSnO (Tc ∼ 5 K) and for Sr3SnO without a superconducting transition in alternating current susceptibility down to 0.15 K. Further, we reveal a significant effect of strontium raw material purity on the superconductivity and achieve substantially increased M/M Meissner (∼1) compared to the highest value reported so far. More detailed characterizations utilizing powder x-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy show that a minor cubic phase, previously suggested to be another Sr3−xSnO phase with a slightly larger lattice parameter, is SrO. The improved characterization and controlled synthesis reported herein enable detailed investigations on the superconducting nature and its dependency on the strontium deficiency in Sr3−xSnO.}

   abstract = "In order to investigate the position of the strontium deficiency in superconductive Sr3−xSnO, we synthesized and measured X-ray-diffraction patterns of Sr3−xSnO (x∼0.5). Because no clear peaks originating from superstructures were observed, strontium deficiency is most likely to be randomly distributed. We also performed first-principles band-structure calculations on Sr3−xSnO (x=0, 0.5) using two methods: full-potential linearized-augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals method and the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method combined with the coherent potential approximation. We revealed that the Fermi energy of Sr3−xSnO in case of x∼0.5 is about 0.8 eV below the original Fermi energy of the stoichiometric Sr3SnO, where the mixing of the valence p and conduction d orbitals are considered to be small."

   abstract = "Bulk superconductivity was recently reported in the antiperovskite oxide Sr3−xSnO, with a possibility of hosting topological superconductivity. We investigated the evolution of superconducting properties such as the transition temperature Tc and the size of the diamagnetic signal, as well as normal-state electronic and crystalline properties, with varying the nominal Sr deficiency x0. Polycrystalline Sr3−xSnO was obtained up to x0 = 0:6 with a small amount of SrO impurities. The amount of impurities increases for x0 > 0.6, suggesting phase instability for high deficiency. Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals an unusual Sn4− ionic state in both stoichiometric and deficient samples. By objectively analyzing superconducting diamagnetism data obtained from a large number of samples, we conclude that the optimal x0 lies in the range 0.5 < x0 < 0.6. In all superconducting samples, two superconducting phases appear concurrently that originate from Sr3−xSnO but with varying intensities. These results clarify the Sr deficiency dependence of the normal and superconducting properties of the antiperovskite oxide Sr3−xSnO will ignite future work on this class of materials.",
