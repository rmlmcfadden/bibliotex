   abstract  ="The surface coating of cathodes using insulator films has proven to be a promising method for high-voltage cathode stabilization in Li-ion batteries{,} but there is still substantial uncertainty about how these films function. More specifically{,} there is limited knowledge of lithium solubility and transport through the films{,} which is important for coating design and development. This study uses first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to examine the diffusivity of interstitial lithium in the crystals of [small alpha]-AlF3{,} [small alpha]-Al2O3{,} m-ZrO2{,} c-MgO{,} and [small alpha]-quartz SiO2{,} which provide benchmark cases for further understanding of insulator coatings in general. In addition{,} we propose an ohmic electrolyte model to predict resistivities and overpotential contributions under battery operating conditions. For the crystalline materials considered we predict that Li+ diffuses quite slowly{,} with a migration barrier larger than 0.9 eV in all crystalline materials except [small alpha]-quartz SiO2{,} which is predicted to have a migration barrier of 0.276 eV along ?001?. These results suggest that the stable crystalline forms of these insulator materials{,} except for oriented [small alpha]-quartz SiO2{,} are not practical for conformal cathode coatings. Amorphous Al2O3 and AlF3 have higher Li+ diffusivities than their crystalline counterparts. Our predicted amorphous Al2O3 resistivity (1789 M[capital Omega] m) is close to the top of the range of the fitted resistivities extracted from previous experiments on nominal Al2O3 coatings (7.8 to 913 M[capital Omega] m) while our predicted amorphous AlF3 resistivity (114 M[capital Omega] m) is very close to the middle of the range. These comparisons support our framework for modeling and understanding the impact on overpotential of conformal coatings in terms of their fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties{,} and support that these materials can provide practical conformal coatings in their amorphous form."

   abstract ={In order to compare the difference between coated and uncoated Si electrode, the basic material properties of atomic layer deposition ALD-Al2O3 coating and native SiO2 layer on Si are investigated by using density functional theory calculations. These properties include: the open circuit voltage curve with respect to lithium metal, the elastic properties, and Li ion diffusion characteristics in SiO2 and Al2O3 and their lithiated compounds (such as Li4SiO4 and LiAlO2). Results show that lithiation occurs at the voltage above EC (Ethylene Carbonate) decomposition(∼0.8V) causing initial irreversible capacity loss. Also, lithiation softens Al2O3 mechanically, while slightly stiffens SiO2. For the Li ion diffusion, SiO2 and Al2O3 have totally different behavior upon lithiation. For SiO2, Li diffuses very fast, but the energy barrier becomes higher as lithiation goes on. When SiO2 is lithiated to Li4SiO4, the diffusion energy barrier becomes lower again. For Al2O3, its intrinsic ionic conductivity is very low, but the Li diffusion energy barrier becomes lower (as low as Li2Si2O5) as lithiation proceeds and LiAlO2 is formed. Therefore, designing ALD coating should target the coating properties after lithiation.},

  abstract={Transport of Na + and Li + under the influence of an electric field in twinned quartz is simulated using molecular dynamics techniques. Comparison between bulk transport and transport along twin boundaries shows that the cations are trapped inside twin walls for weak fields along the crystallographic c -axis. Stronger fields lead to transport along twin walls with significantly lower mobility than in the bulk. With E along [110], transport in the wall is faster than in the bulk. We observe cation trapping preferentially in the twin walls when E is applied out of the plane of the wall.}

  abstract={Li + motion in quartz and β-eucryptite (LiAlSiO 4 ) is investigated by dielectric spectroscopy and classical simulations. Simulations are performed using a combination of traditional energy-minimization (using the GULP code) and a mechanical approach derived from Rigid Unit modelling, implemented in the GASP code. Comparison of the simulation approaches shows that geometrical modelling of cooperative framework motions can be combined with electrostatic and Buckingham interactions to give meaningful results for motion of interstitial ions in quartz frameworks. The experimental results can be accounted for on the basis of Li + motion in the presence of Al substitutional defects.}

Transport data show a large transient increase in ionic current at the α–β phase transition of quartz (the Hedvall effect). The SIMS data indicate two diffusion processes, one involving rapid Li + motion and the other involving penetration of Al and Li atoms into quartz at the phase transition. Atomistic simulations explain why the fine microstructure of twin domain walls in quartz near the transition does not hinder Li + diffusion.}

The samples were both 'as-received' and X-rayed, in the case of the lower-temperature measurements. The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of Al-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions. An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of Na + ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the beta -quartz-to-tridymite transition.}
