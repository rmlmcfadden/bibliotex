   abstract = {Using quantum mechanics (QM, Density Functional Theory) we show that all four phases of barium titanate (BaTiO3) have local Ti distortions toward 〈111〉 (an octahedral face). The stable rhombohedral phase has all distortions in phase (ferroelectric, FE), whereas higher temperature phases have antiferroelectric coupling (AFE) in one, two, or three dimensions (orthorhombic, tetragonal, cubic). This FE{\textendash}AFE model from QM explains such puzzling aspects of these systems as the allowed Raman excitation observed for the cubic phase, the distortions toward 〈111〉 observed in the cubic phase using x-ray fine structure, the small transition entropies, the heavily damped soft phonon modes, and the strong diffuse x-ray scattering in all but the rhombohedral phase. In addition, we expect to see additional weak Bragg peaks at the face centers of the reciprocal lattice for the cubic phase. Similar FE{\textendash}AFE descriptions are expected to occur for other FE materials. Accounting for this FE{\textendash}AFE nature of these phases is expected to be important in accurately simulating the domain wall structures, energetics, and dynamics, which in turn may lead to the design of improved materials.},
