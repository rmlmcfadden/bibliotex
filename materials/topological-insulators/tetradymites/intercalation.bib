   abstract = { Abstract Electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions into Bi2-xInxSe3 crystals (x = 0·0, 0·01, 0·22 and 0·46) has been studied. According to the cyclic voltammograms obtained during the first charge-discharge cycle, the amount C of intercalated Li+ ions depends on the concentration x of In in the crystals; maximum intercalation was observed for the crystals with x = 0·01. The observed dependence of C = f(x) is similar to the concentration dependences of the Hall coefficient, electric conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, that is to the dependence of the concentration of free charge carriers on the concentration of In in the crystals. From an analysis of the relations between intercalation properties and the nature of point defects in Bi2-xInxSe3 crystals it was concluded that changes in the concentration of Se vacancies V⋅⋅ Se are responsible for the observed changes in the intercalation properties of the Bi2-xInxSe3 crystals.}

   abstract  ="Alloys of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) are commonly used in thermoelectric devices. These materials possess a hexagonal layered structure comprised of five atom thick stacks of Te-Bi-Te-Bi-Te held together by weak van der Waals forces. Lithium cations can be intercalated between the layers using the reducing power of solvated electrons in liquid ammonia. After intercalation{,} lithium can be removed by exfoliation to create a stable colloidal suspension of thin sheets of Bi2Te3 or Bi2Se3 in water. Zeta potential measurements indicate that the colloids are charge stabilized. These colloidal suspensions can be deposited onto a variety of substrates to create two-dimensional thin films. Atomic force microscopy indicates that initially individual layers are deposited. The films are partially oriented as observed using X-ray powder diffraction. Annealing at temperatures as low as 85 [degree]C can produce highly oriented films. Thus intercalation{,} exfoliation and deposition from a charge-stabilized colloid can provide a scalable process for synthesizing bulk quantities of nanostructured thermoelectric materials."

   abstract="A two-step method has been used to fabricate nano-particles of layer-structured bismuth chalcogenide compounds, including Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and Bi2Se0.3Te2.7, through a nano-scaled top-down route. In the first step, lithium (Li) atoms are intercalated between the van der Waals bonded quintuple layers of bismuth chalcogenide compounds by controllable electrochemical process inside self-designed lithium ion batteries. And in the second step, the Li intercalated bismuth chalcogenides are subsequently exposed to ethanol, in which process the intercalated Li atoms would explode like atom-scaled bombs to exfoliate original microscaled powder into nano-scaled particles with size around 10 nm. The influence of lithium intercalation speed and amount to three types of bismuth chalcogenide compounds are compared and the optimized intercalation conditions are explored. As to maintain the phase purity of the final nano-particle product, the intercalation lithium amount should be well controlled in Se contained bismuth chalcogenide compounds. Besides, compared with binary bismuth chalcogenide compound, lower lithium intercalation speed should be applied in ternary bismuth chalcogenide compound.",

The calculations of the activation energies of diffusion of adatoms on the surface and in van der Waals gaps near steps, as well as the estimate of diffusion lengths, have shown that efficient intercalation through steps is possible only for Li and Na. Data obtained for K, Rb, and Cs atoms indicate that their thermal desorption at high temperatures can occur before intercalation.

   abstract = "Bismuth chalcogenides Bi2×3 (X=O, S, Se) represent a unique type of materials in diverse polymorphs and configurations. Multiple intrinsic features of Bi2×3 such as narrow bandgap, ion conductivity, and environmental friendliness, have render them attractive materials for a wide array of energy applications. In particular, their rich structural voids and the alloying capability of Bi enable the chalcogenides to be alternative electrodes for energy storage such as hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), sodium (Na) storage and supercapacitors. However, the low conductivity and poor electrochemical cycling are two key challenges for the practical utilization of Bi2×3 electrodes. Great efforts have been devoted to mitigate these challenges and remarkable progresses have been achieved, mainly taking profit of nanotechnology and material compositing engineering. In this short review, we summarize state-of-the-art research advances in the rational design of diverse Bi2×3 electrodes and their electrochemical energy storage performance for H, Li, and Na and supercapacitors. We also highlight the key technical issues at present and provide insights for the future development of bismuth based materials in electrochemical energy storage devices."
