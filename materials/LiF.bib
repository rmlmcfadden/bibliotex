   abstract = {Abstract Lithium fluoride thin films with various thicknesses have been grown on c-plane sapphire substrates by radio-frequency sputtering. The thin films are granular with a preferential [111] orientation of the grains. Thickness-dependent measurements allow the separation of bulk and interface conductions. The normalized conductance decreases linearly with decreasing LiF layer thickness with a negative extrapolated intercept. DC polarization, AC impedance spectroscopy and electromotive force measurement indicate depletion of lithium ion vacancies as majority charge carriers and hence a negative space-charge potential. A generalized Mott–Schottky approach within the model of heterogeneous doping fully explains the entire boundary defect chemistry.},

   abstract = {Abstract For a variety of purposes, solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity are believed to be an alternative to widely used liquid electrolytes. Most of them are developed based on the exploration of crystalline or amorphous structures. As a very rare example of the beneficial influence of glass/ceramic interfaces, we report the conductivity of LiF films on SiO2. The LiF thin films are surprisingly found to be structurally disordered on the silica (0001) surface, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the Li-ion conductivity (6 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 50 °C, with an activation energy of 0.55 eV) of three orders of magnitude. The resulting conductivity is not exceedingly high, but is comparable with that of the current, best thin-film solid electrolyte (Li(3 + x)PO(4 - x)Nx). The conductivity is highest if a significant density of glass/ceramic interfaces is achieved and percolation of the interfaces guaranteed.},

   abstract = { The thermodynamically required redistribution of ions at given interfaces is being paid increased attention. The present investigation of the contact LiF/TiO2 offers a highly worthwhile example, as the redistribution processes can be predicted and verified. It consists in Li ion transfer from LiF into the space charge zones of TiO2. We not only can measure the resulting increase of lithium vacancy conductivity in LiF, we also observe a transition from n- to p-type conductivity in TiO2 in consistency with the generalized space charge model. }

Thickness-dependent measurements of the normalized conductance allow us to separate bulk and interface contributions. The interfacial excess conductivities are discussed on the basis of interfacial space charge models considering depletion or accumulation of lithium vacancy point defects as a consequence of the presence of two-dimensional and one-dimensional defects."
