   abstract = "XCrySDen is a molecular and crystalline-structure visualization program, but its main function is as a property analyzer program. It can run on most UNIX platforms, without any special hardware or software requirements. Special efforts were made to allow for appropriate display of 3D isosurfaces and 2D contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structure and interactively rotated and manipulated. XCrySDen is also a graphical user interface for the CRYSTAL95/98 (Saunders, V. R., et al. CRYSTAL98—User’s Manual. University of Torino, Turin, Italy, 1999) ab initio program and a visualization system for the WIEN97 (Blaha, P., et al. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1990, 59, 399) ab initio program. In this article the program functions are presented with a short description of the algorithms."

   abstract = "The role of computer graphics in different aspects of simulating matter on the atomic scale is discussed. The computer graphics is useful in specifying and examining chemical structures, since it is nowadays possible to study––with density functional theory––complex systems containing up to a few hundreds in-equivalent atoms. Furthermore, computer graphics is also an indispensable tool in analysing computed data and facilitates interpretation of results. In this context XCrySDen (http://www.xcrysden.org/) is presented, a crystalline- and molecular-structure visualisation program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated and manipulated. Another aspect of computer utilisation in simulations that takes advantage of the computer’s graphics capabilities, is that it provides intuitive graphical user interfaces for the simulation setup. It is demonstrated how such interfaces are easily built using the developed GUIB software (http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/)."
