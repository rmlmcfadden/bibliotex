   abstract = {A rainbow colormap is often supplied as a default in visualization software. In this kind of colormap, red is mapped to the highest data value, blue to the lowest, and the other data values are interpolated along the full extent of the spectrum. But there is more to color than meets the eye. Color is a perceptual as well as physical phenomenon. What is commonly called color-hue-is only one of three parameters. Another is the brightness of the signal-intensity. The third is the admixture of white -saturation. Change any one parameter enough, and the color looks different. (The hue-intensity-saturation model of color is one of a several explored through the years, and captures some of the basic characteristics of basic color perception.) To make matters worse, the parameters' relationship to what is perceived is nonlinear. At the same intensity, for example, yellow appears brighter than blue. Some of the perceptual principles involved have been implemented in software developed at IBM Corp.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. The module runs with IBM's visualization package Data Explorer and is called Pravda (for perceptual rule based architecture for visualizing data accurately).},

   abstract = {RGB in graphics is both a way of specifying color and a way of viewing color. Graphics algorithms manipulate RGB colors, and the images produced by graphics algorithms are encoded as RGB pixels and displayed on devices that render these pixels by emitting RGB light. Colored images are also used to specify color in graphics. Most computer graphics texts and tutorials provide a description of human color vision and measurement as defined by the CIE tristimulus values, XYZ. Often missing, however, is an in-depth discussion of the relationship between the different applications of RGB and XYZ, and any discussion of color models beyond trichromacy. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a complete, concise analysis of RGB color specification and its relationship to perceptual and physical specifications of color, and to introduce some models for color perception beyond tristimulus theory.},

   abstract = {Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects more than 4\% of the population and leads to a different visual perception of colors. Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.},
