   abstract = {A multi-purpose pattern-fitting system, RIETAN-2000, has been extensively utilized to contribute to many structural studies. It offers a sophisticated structure-refinement technique of whole-pattern fitting based on the maximum-entropy method (MEM) in combination with a MEM analysis program PRIMA. We have recently completed a successor system, RIETAN-FP, to RIETAN-2000, adding new features such as standardization of crystal-structure data, an extended March-Dollase preferred-orientation function, and automation of imposing restraints on bond lengths and angles. Further, we have been developing a new three-dimensional visualization system, VESTA, using wxWidgets as a C++ application framework. VESTA excels in visualization, rendering, and manipulation of crystal structures and electron/nuclear densities determined by X-ray/neutron diffraction and electronic-structure calculations. VESTA also enables us to display wave functions and electrostatic potentials calculated with part of these programs.}

   abstract = "A cross-platform program, {\it VESTA}, has been developed to visualize both structural and volumetric data in multiple windows with tabs. {\it VESTA} represents crystal structures by ball-and-stick, space-filling, polyhedral, wireframe, stick, dot-surface and thermal-ellipsoid models. A variety of crystal-chemical information is extractable from fractional coordinates, occupancies and oxidation states of sites. Volumetric data such as electron and nuclear densities, Patterson functions, and wavefunctions are displayed as isosurfaces, bird's-eye views and two-dimensional maps. Isosurfaces can be colored according to other physical quantities. Translucent isosurfaces and/or slices can be overlapped with a structural model. Collaboration with external programs enables the user to locate bonds and bond angles in the `graphics area', simulate powder diffraction patterns, and calculate site potentials and Madelung energies. Electron densities determined experimentally are convertible into their Laplacians and electronic energy densities.",
