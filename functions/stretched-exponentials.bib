   abstract = "The empirical dielectric decay function γ(t)= exp –(t/τ0)β may be transformed analytically to give the frequency dependent complex dielectric constant if β is chosen to be 0.50. The resulting dielectric constant and dielectric loss curves are non-symmetrical about the logarithm of the frequency of maximum loss, and are intermediate between the Cole-Cole and Davidson-Cole empirical relations. Using a short extrapolation procedure, good agreement is obtained between the empirical representation and the experimental curves for the α relaxation in polyethyl acrylate. It is suggested that the present representation would have a general application to the α relaxations in other polymers. The Hamon approximation, with a small applied correction, is valid for the present function with β= 0.50 in the range log(ωτ0) > –0.5, but cannot be used at lower frequencies."

   journal = {Rep. Prog. Phys.},
   abstract = {Stretched exponential relaxation, , fits many relaxation processes in disordered and quenched electronic and molecular systems, but it is widely believed that this function has no microscopic basis, especially in the case of molecular relaxation. For electronic relaxation the appearance of the stretched exponential is often described in the context of dispersive transport, where  is treated as an adjustable parameter, but in almost all cases it is generally assumed that no microscopic meaning can be assigned to  even at , a glass transition temperature. We show that for molecular relaxation  can be understood, providing that one separates extrinsic and intrinsic effects, and that the intrinsic effects are dominated by two magic numbers,  for short-range forces, and  for long-range Coulomb forces, as originally observed by Kohlrausch for the decay of residual charge on a Leyden jar. Our mathematical model treats relaxation kinetics using the Lifshitz - Kac - Luttinger diffusion to traps depletion model in a configuration space of effective dimensionality, the latter being determined using axiomatic set theory and Phillips - Thorpe constraint theory. The experiments discussed include ns neutron scattering experiments, particularly those based on neutron spin echoes which measure S( Q,t) directly, and the traditional linear response measurements which span the range from  to s, as collected and analysed phenomenologically by Angell, Ngai, Böhmer and others. The electronic materials discussed include a-Si:H, granular , semiconductor nanocrystallites, charge density waves in , spin glasses, and vortex glasses in high-temperature semiconductors. The molecular materials discussed include polymers, network glasses, electrolytes and alcohols, Van der Waals supercooled liquids and glasses, orientational glasses, water, fused salts, and heme proteins. In the intrinsic cases the theory of  is often accurate to 2\%, which is often better than the quoted experimental accuracies . The extrinsic cases are identified by explicit structural signatures which are discussed at length. The discussion also includes recent molecular dynamical simulations for metallic glasses, spin glasses, quasicrystals and polymers which have achieved the intermediate relaxed Kohlrausch state and which have obtained values of  in excellent agreement with the prediction of the microscopic theory.}

The MSE model exhibits the theoretically correct long- and short-time behavior, and its general applicability for representing transverse-relaxation data is demonstrated for a wide range of rock lithologies and saturating fluids at various magnetic field strengths and echo times. The model also provides a reliable and sample-independent method for signal back-extrapolation, which is necessary for quantitative petrophysical NMR measurements, and overcomes the limitations of the well-known stretched-exponential model."

Analytic error bounds are derived for the low and high frequency series expansions. For intermediate frequencies, the numeric integration is enormously accelerated by using the Ooura–Mori double exponential transformation. The primitive of the cosine transform needed for the convolution integrals is also implemented. The software is hosted at http://apps.jcns.fz-juelich.de/kww; version 3.0 is deposited as supplementary material to this article.},
