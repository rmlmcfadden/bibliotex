   abstract = "Diffusion of Li+ ionsin solidsisa basic principle behindthe operationof Li-ion batteries. Suchdiffusive behavior is represented by the diffusion equation (Fick's law), J = −D × δϕ/δx, where J is the diffusion flux, D is the self diffusion coeffcient, ϕ is the concentration, and x is the position. Although D of Li+ ions(DLi)in solids is usually evaluatedby 7Li-NMR, diffculties arise for materials that contain magnetic ions. This is because the magnetic ions contribute additional spin-lattice relaxation processes thatis considerably larger than the1/T1 expected from only Li diffusion[1], [2], [3]. This implies that 7Li-NMRprovidesa rough estimateof DLi for the positive electrode materials of Li-ion batteries, which include transition metal ions in order to compensate charge neutrality during a Li+ intercala-tion/deintercalation reaction. This is an unsatisfactory situation since DLi is one of the primary parameters that govern the charge/discharge rate of a Li-ion battery. We have, therefore, attempted to measure DLi for lithium-transition-metal-oxides with muon-spin relaxation (μ+SR) since 2005 [4], [5], [6]. Muons do not feel fluctuating magnetic moments at high T, but instead sense the change in nuclear dipole field due to Li diffusion. Even if magnetic moments still affect the muon-spin depolarization rate, such aneffectis, in principle, distinguishablefromthatof nucleardipole fields.In particular,aweak longitudinal field can be applied that decouples the magnetic and nuclear dipole interactions [7], [8]. Here, we wish to summarize our μ+SR study on the lithium-transition-metal-oxides, LixCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiCrO2."

	journal = {Phys. Scr.},
	abstract = {Solid state diffusion is a very complex mechanism and, up until recent studies, such properties had mainly been conducted by macroscopic methods that do not yield true material properties. This has been a major problem for materials development regarding e.g. Li-ion batteries where the basic operational principle is based on the diffusion of Li+ ions. Although the microscopic diffusion coefficient of Li+ (DLi) in solids has been frequently evaluated by Li-NMR, difficulties arise for materials that contain magnetic ions. As a result, it is very difficult to correctly estimate DLi by Li-NMR for most battery materials, particularly for positive electrode materials. Since DLi is one of the primary parameters that governs the charge and discharge rate of Li-ion batteries, such a situation is very unsatisfactory. In order to rectify the shortcomings of NMR and electrochemical measurements, we have developed a novel method that utilizes the muon-spin relaxation (μ+SR) technique to probe the microscopic ion self-diffusion constant (Dion) in a straightforward manner. In this review, we will give an introduction to the method itself but also summarize our μ+SR work on Li-diffusion in battery cathode materials. Furthermore, we will show that the method is not limited to studying only Li-ion diffusion but can also be extended to other groups of compounds and applications e.g. vacancy order formation in transition metal oxides. Finally, we will compare our method with other available microscopic techniques that are able to study ion diffusion in solids, e.g. quasi-elastic neutron scattering, as well as make an outlook toward future developments.}
