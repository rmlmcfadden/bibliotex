   abstract = "For 35 years, the μ+ has been used as a probe of the intrinsic properties of materials and as a light isotope of hydrogen, whose behaviour in many media is of considerable interest. This meeting reviews mainly the latter use, which has achieved much in the last decade in fields ranging from chemistry to quantum diffusion. The next decade offers unprecedented opportunities for μSR, but its unavoidable integration with other accelerator-based programmes renders it vulnerable to ‘politics’. I will explore three questions, often in parallel: (1) ‘So what?’ (What has μSR revealed so far of fundamental or technological importance and how should we aim to exploit its potential?) (2) ‘What next?’ (What new μSR capabilities are likely in the next decade if we extrapolate progress in muon beams, μSR techniques and experimental facilities?) (3) ‘How?’ (Given these priorities, what coherent plan might the μSR community realistically implement by cooperation and organized effort?)"
