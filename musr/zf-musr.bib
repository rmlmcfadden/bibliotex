   journal = {J. Phys.: Condens. Matter},
   abstract = {The authors have derived formal expressions for the positive muon depolarization functions using an iterative procedure both for the longitudinal and transverse experimental geometries. They are valid at least in the motional narrowing limit and at small time. They have used formal expressions to study the depolarization functions for a muon diffusing in a lattice of nuclear dipoles neglecting the possibility of the muon returning to its original localization site. This work indicates that the effect of the spin dynamics on the depolarization functions is important at low fields for both geometries. In the case of the longitudinal geometry it is shown that a second-order iteration formula and the strong collision model with the numerically exact static function give the same result when the muon jumping rate is large enough. This has two important consequences: (i) when the muon jumping rate is sufficiently large it is possible to calculate the whole depolarization function with a modest numerical effort using the iterative formula; and (ii) the fact that the two methods give the same result in the fast diffusing limit shows that the strong collision model with the exact static function contains all the dynamics; the spin-lattice relaxation (T1 process) is included.}

These fields may originate from the Earth, nearby accelerators, and residual fields from spectrometer magnets. We describe a method of determining appropriate trim coil currents to zero the field, which avoids the observation of very low unwanted muon precession frequencies. This method depends on measuring the muonium precession frequencies in a set of x-, y- and z-axis weak transverse field scans, and then calculating the necessary currents to achieve practically zero net field."

   abstract = {We present an accurate and efficient method to calculate the effect of random fluctuations of the local field at the muon, for instance in the case of muon diffusion, within the framework of the strong collision approximation. The method is based on a reformulation of the Markovian process over a discretized time base, leading to a summation equation for the muon polarization function which is solved by discrete Fourier transform. The latter is formally analogous, though not identical, to the integral equation of the original continuous-time model, solved by Laplace transform. With real-case parameter values, the solution of the discrete-time strong collision model is found to approximate the continuous-time solution with excellent accuracy even with a coarse-grained time sampling. Its calculation by the fast Fourier transform algorithm is very efficient and suitable for real time fitting of experimental data even on a slow computer.}
