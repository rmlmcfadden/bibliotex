# bibliotex

This repository contains a rather large collection of `.bib` files,
most of which were accumulated over the course of my graduate studies.
They are loosely organized by category
and have been (mostly) hand-checked for correctness.

Unicode literal are used throughout each `.bib` entry,
meaning you will need XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX
(or something like `glob2bib` for conversion)
for compilation.

The LaTeX package `chemformula` is used extensively for typesetting
chemical formulas.

A convenience script `gen_ref_list.py` is also included.
