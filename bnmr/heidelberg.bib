Nuclear magnetic resonance transitions have been induced and observed via the asymmetric$\Beta$ decay to20Ne, yielding the quadrupole coupling constant {\textbrokenbar}e2q Q/h{\textbrokenbar}=5.77(2)MHz, the quadrupole moment {\textbrokenbar}Q(20F){\textbrokenbar}=0.064(12) b and the asymmetry parameter of the electric field gradient$\eta$=0.317(2). In order to study possible lattice defects produced by the recoil displacement due to the capture$\gamma$-rays NMR signals were registered both at room temperature and at 12 K. Width and depth of the resonance curves indicated that at room temperature nearly all20F ions occupy normal lattice sites with an undisturbed environment. At 12 K, however, where no annealing occurs, this is only true for about half of the20F ions which are stopped directly at defect free sites. The other half of the20F ions at 12 K shows resonance frequencies shifted by defect interactions up to the order of some 100 kHz. Furthermore two simple methods are reported which allow a quick estimate of the strength of the quadrupolar interaction: (1) observation of the$\Beta$ decay asymmetry versus the magnetic field strength (decoupling curve), (2) broad-band modulation of the inducedrf field and observation of the$\Beta$ asymmetry versus the depth of the modulation.",

   abstract = "Nuclear reorientation by external electromagnetic fields is treated using Fano's irreducible tensor formulation of the problem. Although the main purpose of this paper is the description of the effects of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on an ensemble of oriented nuclei in the presence of a crystal electric field gradient (efg), the results are applicable to all types of nuclear or atomic orientation or angular correlation work. Relations are established that allow: (i) to calculate different perturbation coefficient-matricesGkk{\textasciiacutex} andGk1k1 from each other by multiplication with known matrices; (ii) to build up the solution for the mixed electric-magnetic interaction from the solution of the pure magnetic case; (iii) to deduce a high spin solution from a given low spin solution; (iv) to separate the perturbation matrix that connects only longitudinal degrees of orientation. Further we use a perturbation expansion of the solutionsG in powers of the perturbing part of the Liouville matrixL. The theory is applied to a number of exemplary cases: magnetic field dependence of nuclear orientation in the presence of quadrupole interactions; sign determination in electric quadrupole coupling; line shapes of nuclear acoustic resonance (NAR) signals; quadrupole splitting and multiquantum transitions in NMR with oriented nuclei.",

   abstract = "Several problems from radio-frequency spectroscopy of atoms and nuclei are treated with irreducible spin precession theory. In the first part, effective field techniques are used to derive analytically single and multiple quantum double resonance lineshapes for atoms with a hyperfine structure in a high magnetic field. In the second part (as an extension to previous work), nuclear resonance signals are calculated for oriented nuclei subject to an electric hexadecapole interaction. Lineshapes of acoustically driven hexadecapole transitions are derived in closed form and compared to experiment. Further, multiple quantum NMR transitions within a hexadecapole shifted nuclear Zeeman structure are calculated, and some distinct features of hexadecapole effects on NMR lineshapes are pointed out. This last case is of current interest due to recent progress in NMR-line narrowing techniques. --- In the Appendix, we give lineshape equations for single and double quantum NMR transitions on oriented (I=1)-nuclei subject to an electric quadrupole interaction; these equations are also being used in the atomic rf-spectroscopy calculations. The equations are exact to all orders of the interaction with the external fields.",

Two methods are used: 7Li pulsed NMR; and β-radiation detection of 8Li-nuclear polarization produced by polarized neutron capture. Both methods are in qualitative agreement, but a quantitative discrepancy appears in the low-temperature range. Results are discussed in relation with several mechanisms: contact interaction and Korringa relation, quadrupolar mechanism and diffusion modulated dipolar interaction."
