  abstract = "The recently completed ISAC facility at TRIUMF is the most intense source of low-energy radioactive ions in the world. Beams of short-lived radioactive ions have applications in many different areas of physics including condensed matter research. At ISAC we are developing the technique of beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) as a tool for investigating thin structures and dilute impurities. Large nuclear spin polarization can be generated using a fast collinear laser method so that a beam of highly spin polarized ions can be implanted at low energies (1–90 keV). In this paper we describe the facility and the initial experimental program with emphasis on how this technique can complement μSR."

The implantation energy can be continuously adjusted from 1 to 90keV and the maximum polarization achieved thus far is 80\%. This instrument opens up new applications for β-NMR which parallel and complement efforts with low-energy muons. For example, it is possible to probe the magnetic field distribution near the surface of a material by stopping a polarized 8Li beam in a thin overlayer of Ag. Since the 8Li adopts a site with cubic symmetry in Ag there is no quadrupolar splitting of the resonance, and the 8Li acts as a purely magnetic sensor."

We attribute the two lines to two distinct cubic sites with slightly different Knight shifts and discuss the application of this result to study fundamental phenomena exhibited by nano-confined metallic electrons."

Alkali-metal beams are longitudinally polarized by optical pumping of a fast atomic beam, which is created by charge exchange of the incident ion beam in a Na vapour cell. At ISAC, the beam is then reionized in a He gas target and directed to the experiments. To date, 30 keV beams of 8Li and 9Li have been polarized, and 11Li and 20Na beams are scheduled immediately following this conference. The polarization of the 8Li beam, using a dual frequency, standing wave Ti:sapphire laser, is up to ∼80\%. High polarization is achieved by matching the laser bandwidth to the energy spread in the beam. The status of the facility is reported."

In a small magnetic field of 150G, there is a broad peak in 1/T1 near the Curie temperature (Tc=259K) and a dramatic decrease in 1/T1 at lower temperatures. This is attributed to a critical slowing down of the spin fluctuations near Tc and freezing of the magnetic excitations at low temperatures, respectively. In addition, there is a small amplitude, slow relaxing component at high temperatures, which we attribute to 8Li in the SrTiO3 substrate. There is an indication that the spin relaxation rate in the substrate is also peaked at Tc due to close proximity to the magnetic film. These results establish that low-energy β-NMR can be used as a probe of magnetic fluctuations in magnetic thin films over a wide range of temperatures."

The β-NMR frequency spectrum is shown to be a strong function of the implantation energy reflecting the depth dependence of the local hyperfine fields. Correlating the spectra with TRIM.SP implantation profiles allows us to identify signals from the GaAs, Ag and Au layers. The frequency spectrum in Ag is a strong function of energy. A very narrow line, and corresponding distribution of hyperfine fields, is observed when the beam in centered well away from the Fe whereas a much broader distribution is observed when the Li stops close to the Fe. These results demonstrate that low energy β-NMR can act as a sensitive probe of the induced magnetism in the otherwise non-magnetic Ag spacer layers."

The line shape varies weakly as function of magnetic field and temperature but has a strong orientation dependence. The nuclear electric quadrupole splitting is unresolved implying that the electric field gradients are 10–100 times smaller than in other non-cubic crystals. The nuclear spin relaxation rate is also anomalously small but varies linearly with temperature as expected for Korringa relaxation in a metal.

The linewidth of the β-NMR Li+8 resonance increases dramatically above 150K, reaches a maximum at about 290K, and decreases again. This suggests that the Li starts to change its location, probably from an interstitial to a substitutional site, at ≈150K. Experiments in Ge are also described. In this sample, a narrow resonance is seen at low temperatures that is likely due to Li located at an interstitial site. Near room temperature, it appears that Li is converting to another site."

The resonance was found to have a large negative shift with respect to the reference signal in the cubic insulator MgO. This shift exhibited significant temperature dependence on cooling below room temperature, approximately proportionate to the temperature-dependent spin susceptibility of pure Pd. Thus it is tentatively attributed to a Knight shift (K) caused by a large negative hyperfine coupling; a phenomenon common in transition metal ions, but not in alkalis. However, the spin-lattice relaxation of 8Li is much slower than expected from the Korringa law for such a large K. We compare results from samples of very different thicknesses: 12.5μm foil and a 100nm thin film."

The relaxation varies with implantation energy below 28keV as the fraction of the probe Li8 stopping in each layer changes. We attribute the fast relaxating component to the EuO, while the much slower relaxation has contributions from both the Au and the substrate. However, fast relaxation is still observed at the lowest implantation energy where all the Li8 stops in the Au capping layer. This may be due to a proximity effect from the EuO."

The measurements were carried out on a 〈110〉 Cu single crystal where the relaxation rate of the Li8 polarization was monitored as a function of the applied longitudinal magnetic field. The occurrence of cross-relaxation, at a particular magnetic field, between the Li8 and the surrounding nuclei is evident as a resonant enhancement of the relaxation rate at the level crossing field.

The tetragonal distortion accompanying the phase transition modifies the EFG in some 8Liimplantation sites, resulting in an observable loss of 8Lipolarization. This loss of polarization begins at a temperature T*=150K, indicating there is some loss of cubic symmetry well above the bulk transition. We find that the value of T* is unaffected by the range of implantation depths available (10–150nm); however, the temperature dependence of the polarization depends on the surface preparation of the SrTiO3sample."

The absence of quadrupolar splittings greatly simplifies the NMR frequency spectrum. That the muon is spin 12 is one of the reasons it has become so useful as a magnetic probe. Until now there has been no spin 12 probe suitable for beta-detected NMR. Such a probe would be particularly useful in complex materials, which are in general non-cubic. In this paper we describe the development of a low energy beam of spin-polarised 11Be, which is the lightest spin 12 isotope suitable for β-NMR. The intensity of the 11Be+ beam—generated by a laser ionisation source—is about 106/s. The 11Be nuclei are polarised by collinear laser optical pumping with an externally frequency doubled dye laser tuned to the 2S1/2–2P1/2 transition of 11Be+ at 313nm."

The 11\% loss of signal through the magnetic tran-sition is much smaller than that ∼ 50\% found by low energy μSR[1], and may be entirely due to an amplitude change intrinsic to GaAs. This lack of evidence for phase separation is, however, consistent with the full volume fraction magnetism found by a second low energy μSR measurement on a different sample using weak transverse field[2]."

The range of depths probed, from ∼137 nm down to ∼17 nm, coincides with the region of electronic band-bending due to the surface. We ﬁnd a resonance broadened by the host nuclear dipoles, consistent with an earlier report[6], but using a pulsed radio frequency scheme, we are able to make higher resolution measurements. We ﬁnd a small negative shift of the resonance (relative to an MgO reference) at room temperature that is independent of depth. Remarkably, as the temperature is reduced below about 150 K, the resonance shifts negatively and becomes depth dependent, with a larger negative shift deeper into the sample. This shift saturates below 10K, i.e. it does not follow a Curie's law that might be expected for dilute magnetic impurities. Possible origins are discussed."

   abstract = {In order to investigate the diffusive motion of Li + in a thin film electrode material for Li-ion batteries, we have measured β -NMR spectra of 8 Li + ions implanted into epitaxial films of Li 0.7 CoO 2 and LiCoO 2 in the temperature range between 10 and 310 K. Below 100 K, the spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/ T 1 ) in the Li 0.7 CoO 2 film increased with decreasing temperature, indicating the appearance and evolution of localized magnetic moments, as observed with μ + SR. As temperature is increased from 100 K, 1/ T 1 starts to increase above ~ 200 K, where both Li- NMR and μ + SR also sensed an increase in 1/ T 1 due to Li-diffusion. Interestingly, such diffusive behavior was found to depend on the implantation energy, possibly because the surface of the film is decomposed due to chemical instability of the Li 0.7 CoO 2 phase in air. Such diffusive behavior was not observed for the LiCoO 2 film up to 310 K.}

  abstract = {Low temperature growth methods were used to encapsulate a buried Mn δ-doping layer into a silicon host. A β -NMR investigation was performed of the magnetic properties in the temperature range 10 – 300 K using spin-polarized 8 Li + . A depth-dependent broadening and shift of the NMR resonance was detected that is consistent with internal fields distributed at depths of 10 – 30 nm beneath the surface. At low temperatures, a negative relative shift occurred and the resonance was significantly broadened. At 300 K the line-shape could be described by a single Gaussian line, however, at 10 K the line is best approximated by a two component Lorentzian shape consisting of a broad and narrow component as anticipated for a diluted magnetic alloy. The overall magnitude of the resonance shift at both temperatures is small suggesting a weak interaction between the 8 Li + and the magnetic Mn environment.}

Here, we present a brief survey of 8 Li + β -NMR in a variety of insulating polymers at high magnetic field, including polyimide, PET, polycarbonate, polystyrene and polyethylene oxide. In all cases, we find a large-amplitude, broad Lorentzian resonance near the Larmor frequency, consistent with the expected diamagnetic charge state. We also find remarkably fast spin-lattice relaxation rates 1/ T 1 . There is very little dependence of either linewidth or 1/ T 1 on the proton density, the main source of nuclear dipolar magnetic fields, leading us to conclude the main contribution to both broadening and spin relaxation at room temperature is quadrupolar in origin. This behaviour is very different from crystalline insulators such as MgO and Al 2 O 3 , and suggests that 8 Li + β -NMR will be an important probe of polymer dynamics. Additionally, we note dramatically different behaviour of one sample above its glass transition, motivating the construction of a high temperature spectrometer to enable further exploration at elevated temperature.}

At the TRIUMF ISAC facility this is accomplished by in-flight collinear optical pumping with resonant circularly polarized laser light. This reliably produces a high degree of polarization, but the detailed state populations in the beam emerging from the optical polarizer are not well known. These populations are significant as they represent the initial state of the ensemble of probe spins implanted in a β -NMR experiment. Here we use the well-resolved quadrupolar split spectrum of 8 Li + in a high purity single crystal of bismuth to extract the sublevel populations under typical polarizer operating conditions, accounting for the spin relaxation in this semimetal.}
