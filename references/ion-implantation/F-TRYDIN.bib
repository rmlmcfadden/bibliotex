   abstract = "Fractal TRIDYN (F-TRIDYN) is a modified version of the widely used Monte Carlo, Binary Collision Approximation code TRIDYN that includes an explicit model of surface roughness and additional output modes for coupling to plasma edge and material codes. Surface roughness plays an important role in ion irradiation processes such as sputtering; roughness can significantly increase the angle of maximum sputtering and change the maximum observed sputtering yield by a factor of 2 or more. The complete effect of surface roughness on sputtering and other ion irradiation phenomena is not completely understood. Many rough surfaces can be consistently and realistically modeled by fractals, using the fractal dimension and fractal length scale as the sole input parameters. F-TRIDYN includes a robust fractal surface algorithm that is more computationally efficient than those in previous fractal codes and which reproduces available experimental sputtering data from rough surfaces. Fractals provide a compelling path toward a complete and concise understanding of the effect that surface geometry plays on the behavior of plasma-facing materials. F-TRIDYN is a flexible code for simulating ion-solid interactions and coupling to plasma and material codes for multiscale modeling."
