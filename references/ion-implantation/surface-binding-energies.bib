   abstract = "In this paper, we consider a simple model, based on the electronegativity concept, which makes it possible to calculate the surface binding energy of any particles, sputtered from a solid surface by ion bombardment. The model contains empirical equations for calculation of “ionic” and “covalent” parts of the binding energy happened between a surface atom and its close neighbors. The model is strongly desirable in the case of the ion sputtering of any strong electronegative (C, N, O, F, Cl, etc.) or electropositive elements (alkali metals, rare earth elements) from semiconductor surfaces, when the strong ionic binding between these elements and the surface atoms can be estimated."
