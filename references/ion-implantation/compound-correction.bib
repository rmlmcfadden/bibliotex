    abstract = {This article reviews the historical scientific interest in the stopping of ions in compounds. A brief survey is made of the experimental and theoretical scientific status of this field to date. Finally, a simple method is described and evaluated to calculate the stopping of ions in compounds based on the details of the molecular bonding of the material. Results are compared with over 100 experimental stopping values for a variety of ions in many compounds. Agreement between experiment and theory averages about 1\%.}
