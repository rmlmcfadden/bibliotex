	abstract = {Absolute measurements of the energy distributions of energetic light ions back-scattered from solids can be used to determine the electronic stopping power of these ions in the solid. Stopping powers of protons (50–150 keV) in different metals and metal oxides (Nb, Ta, Ta2O5) have been measured by this method. The results depend strongly on the cleanliness of the surface region. The experiments show deviations from the additive rule for the stopping power in compounds in this energy range.}

	abstract = {A UHV system is used to produce aluminum and niobium films by evaporation, to measure the stopping cross section for hydrogen ions and to characterize the targets by backscattering (RBS) and Auger-electron-spectroscopy (AES) without breaking the vacuum. Stopping is measured by the RBS technique in the energy range from 30keV/u to 500keV/u using protons and deuterons as projectiles. The concentrations of impurities (i.e. carbon and oxygen) are derived both from RBS and from Auger-spectra. For Al, both methods yield bulk impurity concentrations below 3\%; for Nb, larger amounts of C and O have been found, the concentration values derived from AES being 2–4 times too high compared to the RBS data. The RBS values are used to correct the stopping cross section for the impurities taking their stopping cross sections from Andersen and Ziegler (1977) and assuming Bragg's rule to be valid. The corrected stopping cross sections are compared to other experimental data and tabulations and to two BEA theories: -that of Burenkow, Komarov and Temkin (1980) and -that of Kührt, Wedell, Semrad and Bauer (1985).}

	abstract = {Numerous studies of stopping power have been reported. In these studies, most of the authors used protons or deuterons for their experiments, while the data from tritons are very rare. This study was performed using a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator, and two experimental methods were used for obtaining the triton beams; one was the acceleration method in which the tritons were directly accelerated from an ion source, and the other was the reaction method in which reaction products from 13C(d, t)12C reaction were used. Several thin metal foils (Al, Ti, Ni, Nb, Ag, Sn, Gd, Ta, Pt, Au, Pb, Bi) were used to obtain the stopping powers for MeV tritons. These data were compared to those of protons; with the assumption that the stopping power depends on the Z (atomic number), but not on the A (mass number) of projectile. This actually means that the stopping power values of protons, deuterons and tritons are equal at the same velocity. The present experiments show consistency with this theoretical assumption within the experimental error of a few percent.}
