	abstract = "The basic physical processes underlying the production of displacement damage in irradiated solids are briefly discussed, including topics from nuclear, atomic, and solid-state physics. Following a general introduction, the concepts of elementary cascade theory are presented as a basis for intuitive descriptions of the damage process. Then the production of primary recoils, mainly by nuclear processes, is discussed in enough detail to prepare a basis for calculating the primary-recoil energy spectra in typical irradiation facilities. The slowing down of fast atomic particles in solids is next discussed as a basis for developing atomistic models of damage production. Finally, several aspects of damage production, as revealed by atomistic simulation models, are outlined."
