	abstract = {Calculation of the classical binary atomic scattering angle is a critical factor in computer simulations of ion beam interactions with matter. Different approaches intended for more accurate results with sufficient speed have been reported in the literature. This paper presents an approach using database evaluation. This approach has been tested and found to be extremely fast (18 times faster than the Biersack-Haggmark's Magic-Formula for scattering [Nucl. Instr. and Meth. 174 (1980) 257]), and its accuracy is better than 0.5\%. This database takes only 216 kB of computer memory.}
