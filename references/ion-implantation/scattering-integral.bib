	abstract = {The development of medium energy backscattering with ions whose energies are as low as 50 keV and whose masses range up to that of 12C+ has generated the need for accurate and efficient mathematical methods for the computation of classical cross sections for screened Coulomb collisions. This paper presents a procedure for the computation which preserves most of the accuracy of more elaborate numerical solutions and is fast enough for all but the most time consuming Monte Carlo calculations. Comparisons are made between this approach and previous computations and approximations, and between the computed scattering cross sections for several screening functions.}

	abstract = {An algorithm has been developed for the Geant4 Monte-Carlo package for the efficient computation of screened Coulomb interatomic scattering. It explicitly integrates the classical equations of motion for scattering events, resulting in precise tracking of both the projectile and the recoil target nucleus. The algorithm permits the user to plug in an arbitrary screening function, such as Lens–Jensen screening, which is good for backscattering calculations, or Ziegler–Biersack–Littmark screening, which is good for nuclear straggling and implantation problems. This will allow many of the applications of the TRIM and SRIM codes to be extended into the much more general Geant4 framework where nuclear and other effects can be included.}
