The depth of this reference damage peak has been measured by using the technique introduced by Westmoreland et al. Lindhard theory fits our random stopping powers till about 150 keV, whereas at energies of 100 keV and lower the data follow the trend of Brandt and Reinheimer3 theory. The ratio (α) between aligned and random stopping powers increases as the energy is lowered going from 0.68 to 0.83 for the channel [110], from 0.70 to 0.90 for the channel [100] and from 0.77 to 0.93 for the channel [111]. }

The investigations are carried out by means of the transmission experiment using silicon targets of several thicknesses. Stopping power values are derived from the peak and the leading edge of energy spectra for channeled particles. Special procedures are applied to correct the obtained stopping power data with respect to the target thickness. In the case of leading edge the stopping power data depend strongly on the target thickness. It is shown that only the extrapolation to zero thickness leads to correct stopping power values for best channeled particles. It is found that the ratio of channeled to random stopping power shows a maximum in the energy region at about 70 keV. Here the stopping power for channeling and random directions reach their largest value, too.},

The samples prepared are Sb(1ML)Si(001) and amorphous Si (a-Si)/Sb(1ML)/Si(001) and a-GeSi(111) formed by molecular beam epitaxy and with an electron beam evaporator. Atomic force and cross sectional transmission electron microscopes revealed the formation of uniform and amorphous thin films with sharp interfaces. Ion scattering measurements were performed in situ first for Sb(1ML)Si(001) and subsequently for a-Si films deposited on Sb(1ML)Si(001) under an ultrahigh vacuum condition. The Sb peak shift and the broadening of the Sb energy spectrum give the stopping power and energy straggling, respectively. For a-Ge films, we extracted the stopping power and straggling values from the energy width and the slopes at the front and rear edges of the Ge spectrum, respectively. The present results are compared with the theoretical predictions and other experimental data.}

The low-energy results are reproduced by model calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, which indicate that the inelastic energy loss does not show a dependence upon the impact parameter in the low energy region.

The fitted random stopping power is within 6% of the latest versions of the stopping powers of Paul (http://www.exphys.uni-linz.ac.at/Stopping) and of SRIM (http://www.srim.org). The electronic energy loss in the center of the widest channel in Si, the [110] channel, is only slightly lower than in random direction, the maximum difference being 13% at the stopping power maximum. The precise shape of the range profiles of H channeled along [110] can only be reproduced by assuming a significantly higher electronic energy loss straggling than proposed in the literature.}

A detection geometry coupling simultaneously two solid-state Si detectors placed at 165° and 150° relative to each side of the incident beam direction was used to measure the energies of the scattered ions and determine their energy losses within the stopping medium. In this way, the basic energy parameter, Ex, at the Si/SiO2 interface for a given incident energy E0 is the same for ions backscattered in the two directions off both the Si and O target elements, and systematic uncertainties in the ε(E) data mainly originating from the target thickness are significantly minimized. A powerful computer code has been elaborated for extracting the relevant ε(E) experimental data and the associated overall uncertainty that amounts to less than 3%. The measured ε(E) data sets were found to be in fair agreement with Paul’s compilation and with values calculated by the SRIM 06 computer code. In the case of 4He+ ions, experimental data for the γ effective charge parameter have been deduced by scaling the measured stopping cross sections to those of protons crossing the same target with the same velocity, and compared to the predictions of the SRIM 06 computer code. It is found that the γ-parameter values generated by the latter code slightly deviate from experiment over the velocity region around the stopping cross section maximum where strong charge exchanges usually occur.}
