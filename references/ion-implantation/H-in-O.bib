	% abstract = {Energy loss of protons in N2, air O2, Ne, Ar, Kr, CH4 and CO2 has been measured as a function of incident energy from 0.4 to 3.4 MeV. The incident beam of protons from a Van de Graaff accelerator was scattered from a thin gold foil into an isolated gas cell. A surface barrier solid state detector and a 512-channel pulse height analyzer were used to measure the energy of the protons after they had traversed the gas cell. The experimental results obtained have a probable error of 2–5%. Comparison of these results has been made with available experimental results, Whaling's stopping power curves and the Lindhard-Scharff theory.}

Our results give a surprisingly good confirmation of the Lindhard-Scharff statistical theory which predicts a linear velocity dependence of the electronic stopping power at low projectile energies. Moreover our data are in fair agreement with earlier high energy (E ≧ 20 keV) measurements in other laboratories. The combination of the present measurements with theoretically calculated nuclear stopping powers yields an estimate of the atomic stopping power. This estimate leads to substantially lower atomic stopping powers at low energies compared to values derived from range measurements. This result may have interesting implications on auroral hydrogen emissions.",

The protons were scattered off a thin gold foil mounted in the center of a gas-filled scattering chamber. The energy loss in the gas is given by the shift of the elastic peak measured with and without gas filling. The experimental data were fitted using the semi-empirical five-parameter formula of Andersen and Ziegler. Shell corrections were calculated from the measured stopping powers and compared to the theoretical shell-correction calculations of Bonderup which are based on the Lindhard-Scharff model.}

From the stopping cross sections of protons and 4He-ions at same velocity higher order Z1 corrections (Barkas-correction) for the noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe and the diatomic gases H2, N2 and O2 were calculated, using theoretical values for the Bloch-correction approximated by Bichsel and Porter. The experimental Z13-corrections were compared with the different theoretical predictions of Ashley, Ritchi and Brandt, Jackson and McCarthy and Lindhard and Esbensen.}

One-half of the experimental data obtained for molecules N2 and O2 was compared with that of experimental data for 4.4 MeV protons reported by Brolley and Ribe [Phys. Rev. 98 (1955)1112], the calculated values given in ICRU Report 49 [Stopping Powers and Ranges for Protons and Alpha Particles (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, 1993)], and the values calculated by Andersen and Ziegler's formula [Hydrogen Stopping Powers and Ranges in All Elements (Pergamon, New York, 1977)] for atoms N and O. By analyzing the experimental results with the modified Bethe–Bloch formula that includes the Barkas correction term, we extracted the mean excitation energies, the I values, for N and O. The I values were compared with other reported values.}
