    abstract = {Rate constants are reported for the reaction of muonium atoms in water with some 36 organic compounds, many of interest in biology. These kM values range from < l05 to 7 × 1010 M−1 s−1, according to the type of reaction involved, with the sugar–phosphate backbones of nucleic acids being at the low end and their bases at the high end. They are compared with corresponding published H-atom data (kH), where possible, and show kinetic-isotope-effects ranging over five orders of magnitude. Since all kH data were obtained at pH = 1, while kM values refer to pH ~ 7 of the natural state, the pH-dependence of kM was examined in representative cases. The changes found result from protonation of the solute rather than a changed reactivity of Mu on being converted to MuH+. On localizing the solutes in the hydrophobic phase of dilute micelles, the reactivity of Mu was again measured (kM(mic)). The resulting "enhancement" factor was considered in terms of: the reaction mechanism, its dependence on microenvironment (solvation), and the concentrating effect of mutual confinement to small sections of a biphasal system. Key words: kinetic isotope effects, muonium, biochemicals, micelles.}

The temperature dependence of the reduced hyperfine coupling constant, A′, was determined for both samples. In addition, superparamagnetic relaxation processes associated with the iron–dextran cores were characterized. The resulting zero-field muon spin relaxation is found to be stretched exponential in form, indicating a broad distribution of correlation times for the internal magnetic fields, whilst the temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate provides evidence that the superparamagnetic relaxation follows a thermally activated Arrhenius behaviour with a characteristic activation energy Ea/k = 84 K.

Evidence for an increase in higher dimensional motion is seen around 200K in cytochrome c, apparently reflecting structural change. For myoglobin the variation with temperature is different, reflecting the different protein dynamics of this molecule."

No ALC-μSR resonances were observed from polycrystalline samples of the sugar ribose or potassium phosphate at 300 K. Preliminary ALC-μSR spectra of a double stranded (ds) DNA sample are reported and found to show additional resonances to those of the nucleic acid bases, indicating the behavior of implanted muons in dsDNA to be more complex than a simple sum of the behaviors found with the bases. The reported data are also pertinent to H atom adducts of these materials, where the hyperfine parameters are scaled by the ratio of the gyromagentic ratio of the muon to that of the proton.}

The labelled electron method using positive muons allows such transfer processes in macromolecules, such as polymers and proteins, to be probed on a microscopic level. Here we present the results of an experiment using the labelled electron method with longitudinal field muon spin relaxation (LF-μSR) to investigate electron-transfer processes in dextran. The data are well described using the Risch–Kehr model and the results suggest intra-chain diffusion is the dominant transport process in this system between 15 and 250 K. Intra-chain diffusion rates of 1013 s−1 have been determined.}

Gaining insight into the formation of such sites by protonation and/or electronation is therefore of significant value in fully exploiting the potential of such systems. Here, we show that the muonium radical (Mu.), used as a low isotopic mass analogue of hydrogen, can be exploited to probe the early stages of hydride formation at metal centers. Mu. undergoes the same chemical reactions as H. and can be directly observed due to its short lifetime (in the microseconds) and unique breakdown signature. By implanting Mu. into three models of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase active site we have been able to detect key muoniated intermediates of direct relevance to the hydride chemistry of these systems.},

    abstract = {The radicals formed by muonium (Mu) addition to four nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) have been characterized by avoided level-crossing muon spin resonance (ALC-μSR). Mu is considered to be a light isotope of the hydrogen atom, and the muoniated radicals observed by ALC-μSR are isotopomers of the radicals initially produced by H addition to the nucleobases. The observed radicals have been assigned by considering the relative energies of the possible radicals reported in the literature and comparing the experimental muon and proton hyperfine coupling constants with values from previously reported electron paramagnetic resonance and ab initio calculations that have been scaled to account for the larger magnetic moment of the muon and its lighter mass compared with the proton. Mu addition is observed to occur only at secondary carbons of the purine rings in adenine and guanine. Mu adds to C8 and C2 of adenine with the relative amount being ∼70:30\%, and Mu adds exclusively to C8 of guanine. Mu addition is predominantly to the secondary carbons of the pyrimidine ring in cytosine (C5 and C6 with relative yields ∼80:20\%) with a small amount of addition at N3. Mu adds to both the secondary C6 and tertiary C5 in thymine with approximately equal yields as well as the O4 adduct being a minor product.}
