   abstract = "The principle motivation of natural sciences is the desire to learn about the nature of matter and about its interaction with forces, with the main aibeing to understand fundamentally where we all come from and what it is that keeps nature going. In this century, scientists have not only set off to investigate the macroscopic world of the universe as a whole, they have also succeeded in penetrating the microscopic world to learn more about the structure of molecules, of atoms and their nuclei, and they even break up nuclei to find the most elementary building blocks of matter. A major breakthrough for a detailed understanding of the microworld occurred in the twenties when the concepts of quantum mechanics were introduced. They mark the beginning of the victorious evolution of spectroscopic techniques which are today the most widespread tools to investigate the microworld Thereby, matter is subjected to electromagnetic radiation spanning a range of more than ten orders of magnitude in wavelength between X-rays and radio waves. The response of matter to these waves is often very specific, so that it allows detailed insight into its structure and dynamics.",

   abstract = "Muonium (Mu) and protium (1H) differ by only 0.43\% in reduced mass but by a factor of 8.8 in atomic mass{,} so they constitute an excellent pair of atoms with which to examine kinetic isotope effects. When these atoms react with solutes in water{,} the ratio of observed rate constants (kM/kH) ranges from 103 to 10−2. Many of these effects can be accounted for by differences in diffusion{,} zero-point energies{,} quantum tunneling and steric hindrance when they involve a single reaction channel to form isotopomeric products. But there are also isotope effects which differ in kind not just in degree{,} where different reactions are involved for Mu and H leading to different reaction products. In general{,} Mu falls between H-atoms and hydrated electrons in its reactivity. Examples where Mu and H take different paths include Mu behaving as a nucleophilic addition reagent towards substituted benzenes{,} and where Mu adds to the carbonyl of a ketone while H abstracts a hydrogen from an adjacent alkyl group.This is certainly not an exhaustive review of Mu vs. H kinetic isotope effects in solution. Rather{,} it is a selective look at some 25 solutes in water—which includes most of those showing subtle or unusual effects{,} and those which have emerged as a result of the unique mass difference and the potential quantum character of these two H-isotopes."

   abstract = "This chapter focuses on the positive muon (μ+) as a probe in chemistry and introduces some basic aspects including typical radiation chemical effects, spectroscopic observations, and applications in investigations of kinetics and dynamics. With a single positive charge and a mass one-ninth of the proton mass, the muon mimics a light proton in matter. Muonium (Mu) is simply a light hydrogen isotope. The muon is a spin-l/2 particle with a magnetic moment 3.18 times that of the proton and it is obtained at the ports of suitable accelerators with a spin polarization close to 100\%. This makes it an ideal magnetic probe. The signature of its chemical nature is based on its magnetic properties, and the experimental techniques for it are closely related to magnetic resonance. Mu addition to double bonds places the muon two bonds away from the radical center. Thus, Mu is not normally directly involved in reactions of the radical, and any kinetic isotope effects are secondary and small. This makes the muon a non-perturbing radical kinetics probe. Its advantage is the extraordinary sensitivity of the technique, which requires only a single muon in the sample at a given time."

The muonium atom is a light hydrogen isotope, nine times lighter than H, with a muon as its nucleus. It reacts the same way as H, and by addition to double bonds it is implemented in free radicals in which the muon serves as a fully polarized spin label. It is reviewed here how the muon can be used to obtain information about muonium and radical reaction rates, radical structure, dynamics, and local environments.

The muoniated radicals are characterized by a series of magnetic resonance techniques known as μSR for muon spin rotation, resonance and relaxation spectroscopy. In this review it is shown how μSR can be used to obtain information about the structure, dynamics, and local environments of transient radicals in solids like zeolites, in solution or even in exotic solvents like supercritical water. It will also be demonstrated that muoniated radicals can be used as probes in complex systems, such as rod-like and discotic liquid crystals, bilayers and polymers, where they have advantages over traditional spin labelling."
