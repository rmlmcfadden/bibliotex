abstract = "The implantation of low energy polarized positive muons (μ+) with energies between 0.5 and 30 keV in thin (<100 nm) Al, Cu, Ag, and Au films sputtered onto quartz glass substrates has been studied by using a muon spin rotation technique. The fraction of muons stopped in the metal was determined by measuring the energy dependence of the μ+ decay asymmetry which is essentially proportional to the fraction of μ+ stopping in the metal layer. From this quantity also the backscattering probability from the metallic layer can be obtained. The results are compared with predictions of implantation profiles of muons obtained with the TRIM.SP and SRIM2000 Monte Carlo codes. The applicability of these simulations to predict the interaction of low energy muons in matter and observed differences with the experimental data are discussed."

   abstract = "Questions involving thin films, multilayered samples, surfaces and interfaces are generally not accessible by the conventional sources delivering muons with kinetic energy ∼4MeV. The muon as a sensitive local magnetic and spin probe with complementary observational time window to other probes and techniques is able to offer unique new insights into these objects of investigations. Low energy muons (LE-μ+) with tunable energy between ∼0.5 and 30keV penetrate only to a depth between a few and few hundreds of nm depending on their energy. Hence they provide the desired non-destructive, non-invasive and microscopic probe for local investigations of properties near surfaces and in thin samples. The intensity of the LE-μ+ source at PSI and the capability of the sample environment have been steadily evolving over the past years and the flux at the sample has now reached intensities of more than 700μ+/s. After a summary of the most recent developments we give a brief overview of the experimental program together with some anticipated applications. The measurement of the value of local magnetic fields as a function of position below a surface on a scale of a few nm, which has provided the first direct confirmation of the London formula and has the potential to yield information crucial to understanding the details of the superconducting state, has been used to map films of non-conventional and conventional superconductors. Investigations of magnetic systems range from the first studies of magnetic properties of buried thin films to investigations of dimensional effects in a single spin glass layer and interlayer coupling in magnetic-nonmagnetic systems. The future prospects of this technique are outlined. To optimize the flux of LE-μ+ at PSI a new, dedicated surface muon beam line has been designed. It is presently under construction and will be installed in 2003/2004. The predicted intensity increase by a factor of about ten will contribute to the realization of the full potential of polarized muons used as nanoprobes."

For example it is possible to study magnetic field profiles near the surface of superconductors and directly determine fundamental quantities such as the magnetic penetration depth. Low energy muons (LE-μ+) also allow mapping the spin polarization in multilayered structures, for instance that of the conduction electrons of a non-magnetic buried layer in between thin ferromagnetic layers.}

   abstract = "We have produced a pulsed beam of low energy (ultra slow) polarized positive muons (LE-μ+) and performed several demonstration muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR) experiments at ISIS RIKEN-RAL muon facility in UK. The energy of the muons implanted into a sample is tuneable between 0.1keV and 18keV. This allows us to use muons as local magnetic microprobes on a nanometre scale. The control over the implantation depth is from several nanometres to hundreds of nanometres depending on the sample density and muon energy. The LE-μ+ are produced by two-photon resonant laser ionization of thermal muonium atoms. Currently ∼15 LE-μ+/s with 50\% spin polarization are transported to the μSR sample position, where they are focused to a small spot with a diameter of only 4mm. The overall LE-μ+ generation efficiency of 3×10−5 is comparable to that obtained when moderating the muon beam to epithermal energies in simple van der Waals bound solids. In contrast to other methods of LE-μ+ generation, the implantation of the muons into the sample can be externally triggered with the duration of the LE-μ+ pulse being only 7.5ns. This allows us to measure spin rotation frequencies of up to 40MHz."
