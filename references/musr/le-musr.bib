   abstract = "Questions involving thin films, multilayered samples, surfaces and interfaces are generally not accessible by the conventional sources delivering muons with kinetic energy ∼4MeV. The muon as a sensitive local magnetic and spin probe with complementary observational time window to other probes and techniques is able to offer unique new insights into these objects of investigations. Low energy muons (LE-μ+) with tunable energy between ∼0.5 and 30keV penetrate only to a depth between a few and few hundreds of nm depending on their energy. Hence they provide the desired non-destructive, non-invasive and microscopic probe for local investigations of properties near surfaces and in thin samples. The intensity of the LE-μ+ source at PSI and the capability of the sample environment have been steadily evolving over the past years and the flux at the sample has now reached intensities of more than 700μ+/s. After a summary of the most recent developments we give a brief overview of the experimental program together with some anticipated applications. The measurement of the value of local magnetic fields as a function of position below a surface on a scale of a few nm, which has provided the first direct confirmation of the London formula and has the potential to yield information crucial to understanding the details of the superconducting state, has been used to map films of non-conventional and conventional superconductors. Investigations of magnetic systems range from the first studies of magnetic properties of buried thin films to investigations of dimensional effects in a single spin glass layer and interlayer coupling in magnetic-nonmagnetic systems. The future prospects of this technique are outlined. To optimize the flux of LE-μ+ at PSI a new, dedicated surface muon beam line has been designed. It is presently under construction and will be installed in 2003/2004. The predicted intensity increase by a factor of about ten will contribute to the realization of the full potential of polarized muons used as nanoprobes."

	abstract = {Implanting low-energy muons on the nanometer scale beneath the surface of a superconductor in the Meissner state enabled us to probe the evanescent magnetic field profile B(z) (0<z≲200nm, z the distance from the surface). All the investigated samples [Nb: κ≃0.7(2), Pb: κ≃0.6(1), Ta: κ≃0.5(2)] show clear deviations from the simple exponential B(z) expected in the London limit, and reveal the nonlocal response of these superconductors. From a quantitative analysis within the Pippard and BCS models the London penetration depth λL is extracted. Both, the Pippard and BCS description of B(z), are less accurate the smaller κ is. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the decrease of the superfluid density on approaching the surface on the length scale ξ is not taken self-consistently into account in the mentioned models. Such an effect should be more pronounced in the lowest κ regime, consistent with our findings.}

   abstract = "We have produced a pulsed beam of low energy (ultra slow) polarized positive muons (LE-μ+) and performed several demonstration muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR) experiments at ISIS RIKEN-RAL muon facility in UK. The energy of the muons implanted into a sample is tuneable between 0.1keV and 18keV. This allows us to use muons as local magnetic microprobes on a nanometre scale. The control over the implantation depth is from several nanometres to hundreds of nanometres depending on the sample density and muon energy. The LE-μ+ are produced by two-photon resonant laser ionization of thermal muonium atoms. Currently ∼15 LE-μ+/s with 50\% spin polarization are transported to the μSR sample position, where they are focused to a small spot with a diameter of only 4mm. The overall LE-μ+ generation efficiency of 3×10−5 is comparable to that obtained when moderating the muon beam to epithermal energies in simple van der Waals bound solids. In contrast to other methods of LE-μ+ generation, the implantation of the muons into the sample can be externally triggered with the duration of the LE-μ+ pulse being only 7.5ns. This allows us to measure spin rotation frequencies of up to 40MHz."

Over the years they have provided unique information about magnetic, superconducting and other electronic properties of bulk matter.

This allows depth-dependent μSR-studies of thin films, near-surface regions and multilayered structures in the range from ∼1 to ∼300nm. After a brief introduction of the present status of this technique, some experiments are overviewed including depth-dependent studies of thin films and heterostructures of various magnetic and superconducting materials, ranging from cuprates through spin glasses to structures and compounds relevant to spintronics applications."

TRIM assumes an amorphous stopping medium. MARLOWE is also a BCA code, but treats the stopping medium as crystalline. MUSCLE uses a molecular dynamics approach and should be even more accurate. For the results shown here we use bcc Fe. TRIM, MARLOWE, and MUSCLE are Monte-Carlo codes. We find that the average penetration depths are similar, but that the detailed shapes of the penetration distributions are quite different. When the dependence of the interpretation of experiments depends on the relative probabilities of penetration depth, a use of code which includes the effects of crystallinity is recommended.}
