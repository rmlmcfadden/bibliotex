	abstract = "Questions involving thin films, multilayered samples, surfaces and interfaces are generally not accessible by the conventional sources delivering muons with kinetic energy ∼4MeV. The muon as a sensitive local magnetic and spin probe with complementary observational time window to other probes and techniques is able to offer unique new insights into these objects of investigations. Low energy muons (LE-μ+) with tunable energy between ∼0.5 and 30keV penetrate only to a depth between a few and few hundreds of nm depending on their energy. Hence they provide the desired non-destructive, non-invasive and microscopic probe for local investigations of properties near surfaces and in thin samples. The intensity of the LE-μ+ source at PSI and the capability of the sample environment have been steadily evolving over the past years and the flux at the sample has now reached intensities of more than 700μ+/s. After a summary of the most recent developments we give a brief overview of the experimental program together with some anticipated applications. The measurement of the value of local magnetic fields as a function of position below a surface on a scale of a few nm, which has provided the first direct confirmation of the London formula and has the potential to yield information crucial to understanding the details of the superconducting state, has been used to map films of non-conventional and conventional superconductors. Investigations of magnetic systems range from the first studies of magnetic properties of buried thin films to investigations of dimensional effects in a single spin glass layer and interlayer coupling in magnetic-nonmagnetic systems. The future prospects of this technique are outlined. To optimize the flux of LE-μ+ at PSI a new, dedicated surface muon beam line has been designed. It is presently under construction and will be installed in 2003/2004. The predicted intensity increase by a factor of about ten will contribute to the realization of the full potential of polarized muons used as nanoprobes."

All the investigated samples [Nb: κ≃0.7(2), Pb: κ≃0.6(1), Ta: κ≃0.5(2)] show clear deviations from the simple exponential B(z) expected in the London limit, and reveal the nonlocal response of these superconductors. From a quantitative analysis within the Pippard and BCS models the London penetration depth λL is extracted. Both, the Pippard and BCS description of B(z), are less accurate the smaller κ is. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the decrease of the superfluid density on approaching the surface on the length scale ξ is not taken self-consistently into account in the mentioned models. Such an effect should be more pronounced in the lowest κ regime, consistent with our findings.}

	abstract = "We have produced a pulsed beam of low energy (ultra slow) polarized positive muons (LE-μ+) and performed several demonstration muon spin rotation/relaxation (μSR) experiments at ISIS RIKEN-RAL muon facility in UK. The energy of the muons implanted into a sample is tuneable between 0.1keV and 18keV. This allows us to use muons as local magnetic microprobes on a nanometre scale. The control over the implantation depth is from several nanometres to hundreds of nanometres depending on the sample density and muon energy. The LE-μ+ are produced by two-photon resonant laser ionization of thermal muonium atoms. Currently ∼15 LE-μ+/s with 50\% spin polarization are transported to the μSR sample position, where they are focused to a small spot with a diameter of only 4mm. The overall LE-μ+ generation efficiency of 3×10−5 is comparable to that obtained when moderating the muon beam to epithermal energies in simple van der Waals bound solids. In contrast to other methods of LE-μ+ generation, the implantation of the muons into the sample can be externally triggered with the duration of the LE-μ+ pulse being only 7.5ns. This allows us to measure spin rotation frequencies of up to 40MHz."

The competition between collective quantum phases in materials with strongly correlated electrons depends sensitively on the dimensionality of the electron system, which is difficult to control by standard solid-state chemistry. We have fabricated superlattices of the paramagnetic metal lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3) and the wide-gap insulator lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) with atomically precise layer sequences. We used optical ellipsometry and low-energy muon spin rotation to show that superlattices with LaNiO3 as thin as two unit cells undergo a sequence of collective metal-insulator and antiferromagnetic transitions as a function of decreasing temperature, whereas samples with thicker LaNiO3 layers remain metallic and paramagnetic at all temperatures. Metal-oxide superlattices thus allow control of the dimensionality and collective phase behavior of correlated-electron systems.}

Here we probe the local diamagnetic response in the normal state of an underdoped La1.94Sr0.06CuO4 layer (Tc{\textasciiacutex}≤5 K), which is brought into close contact with two nearly optimally doped La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 layers (Tc≈32 K). We show that the entire 'barrier' layer of thickness, much larger than the typical c axis coherence lengths of cuprates, exhibits a Meissner effect at temperatures above Tc{\textasciiacutex} but below Tc. The temperature dependence of the effective penetration depth and superfluid density in different layers indicates that superfluidity with long-range phase coherence is induced in the underdoped layer by the proximity to optimally doped layers, but this induced order is sensitive to thermal excitation.",

TRIM assumes an amorphous stopping medium. MARLOWE is also a BCA code, but treats the stopping medium as crystalline. MUSCLE uses a molecular dynamics approach and should be even more accurate. For the results shown here we use bcc Fe. TRIM, MARLOWE, and MUSCLE are Monte-Carlo codes. We find that the average penetration depths are similar, but that the detailed shapes of the penetration distributions are quite different. When the dependence of the interpretation of experiments depends on the relative probabilities of penetration depth, a use of code which includes the effects of crystallinity is recommended.}

	% abstract = { The organization of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) on surfaces via thermal sublimation is a prerequisite for the development of future devices for spintronics exploiting the richness of properties offered by these magnetic molecules. However, a change in the SMM properties due to the interaction with specific surfaces is usually observed. Here we present a rare example of an SMM system that can be thermally sublimated on gold surfaces while maintaining its intact chemical structure and magnetic properties. Muon spin relaxation and ac susceptibility measurements are used to demonstrate that, unlike other SMMs, the magnetic properties of this system in thin films are very similar to those in the bulk, throughout the full volume of the film, including regions near the metal and vacuum interfaces. These results exhibit the robustness of chemical and magnetic properties of this complex and provide important clues for the development of nanostructures based on SMMs. }

An example of these materials is the layered oxide perovskite Sr2RuO4, which has been intensively investigated due to its unusual properties. Whilst the debate on the symmetry of the superconducting state in Sr2RuO4 is still ongoing, a deeper understanding of the Sr2RuO4 normal state appears crucial as this is the background in which electron pairing occurs. Here, by using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy we discover the existence of surface magnetism in Sr2RuO4 in its normal state. We detect static weak dipolar fields yet manifesting at an onset temperature higher than 50{\thinspace}K. We ascribe this unconventional magnetism to orbital loop currents forming at the reconstructed Sr2RuO4 surface. Our observations set a reference for the discovery of the same magnetic phase in other materials and unveil an electronic ordering mechanism that can influence electron pairing with broken time reversal symmetry.",

	abstract = {Abstract As devices become smaller and more complex, the interfaces between adjacent materials become increasingly important and are often critical to device performance. An important research goal is to improve the interface between the absorber and the window layer by inserting buffer layers to adjust the transition. Depth-resolved studies are key for a fundamental understanding of the interface. In the present experiment, the interface between the chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber and various buffer layers are investigated using low-energy muon spin rotation (μSR) spectroscopy. Depth resolution in the nm range is achieved by implanting the muons with different energies so that they stop at different depths in the sample. Near the interface, a region about 50 nm wide is detected where the lattice is more distorted than further inside the absorber. The distortion is attributed to the long-range strain field caused by defects. These measurements allow a quantification of the corresponding passivation effect of the buffer layer. Bath-deposited cadmium sulfide provides the best defect passivation in the near interface region, in contrast to the dry-deposited oxides, which have a much smaller effect. The experiment demonstrates the great potential of low energy μSR spectroscopy for microscopic interfacial studies of multilayer systems.},

	abstract = {The analysis of depth-dependent data of thin film semiconductor heterostructures is discussed in this work. The data is obtained by varying muon implantation energy, E, using the Low-Energy Muon (LEM) facility at PSI, Switzerland. Since the measurement method has a finite resolution, unfolding of the measured profile with the resolution function is required. The unfolding can be performed in the real space (that is in depth variable x), using range distribution function, P(x, E), obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. As will be shown, it is much simpler to perform the unfolding in the implantation energy space and to transform the results afterwards into real space. This simplifies the analysis considerably, since the universal range distributions can be used, independent of the specific sample.}

	abstract = {Abstract Muon spin rotation with low-energy muons (LE-µSR) is a powerful nuclear method where electrical and magnetic properties of surface-near regions and thin films can be studied on a length scale of ≈200 nm. This study shows the potential of utilizing low-energy muons for a depth-resolved characterization of oxide-semiconductor interfaces, i.e., for silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (4H-SiC). The performance of semiconductor devices relies heavily on the quality of the oxide-semiconductor interface; thus, investigation of defects present in this region is crucial to improve the technology. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and grown by thermal oxidation of the SiO2-semiconductor interface are compared with respect to interface and defect formation. The nanometer depth resolution of LE-µSR allows for a clear distinction between the oxide and semiconductor layers, while also quantifying the extension of structural changes caused by the oxidation of both Si and SiC. The results demonstrate that LE-µSR can reveal unprecedented details on the structural and electronic properties of the thermally oxidized SiO2-semiconductor interface.},

	abstract = {Copper oxide superconductors universally exhibit multiple forms of electronically ordered phases that break the native translational symmetry of the CuO2 planes. In underdoped cuprates with correlated metallic ground states, charge/spin stripes and incommensurate charge density waves (CDWs) have been experimentally observed over the years, while early theoretical studies also predicted the emergence of a Coulomb-frustrated ‘charge crystal’ phase in the very lightly doped, insulating limit of CuO2 planes. Here, we search for signatures of CDW order in very lightly hole-doped cuprates from the 123 family RBa2Cu3O7 − δ (RBCO; R: Y or rare earth), by using resonant X-ray scattering, electron transport, and muon spin rotation measurements to resolve the electronic and magnetic ground states fully. Specifically, Pr is used to substitute Y at the R-site to systematically suppress the superconductivity and access the extremely low hole-doping regime of the cuprate phase diagram without changing the oxygen stoichiometry. X-ray scattering data taken on Pr-doped YBCO thin films reveal an in-plane CDW order that follows the same linear evolution of wave vector versus hole concentration as oxygen-underdoped YBCO but extends all the way to the insulating and magnetically ordered Mott limit. Combined with the recent observation of charge crystal phase on an insulating surface of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + z, our results in RBCO suggest that this electronic symmetry breaking is universally present in very lightly doped CuO2 planes. These findings bridge the gap between the Mott insulating state and the underdoped metallic state and underscore the prominent role that Coulomb-frustrated electronic phase separation plays among all cuprates.}

	abstract = {The interface between two different materials can show unexpected quantum phenomena. In this study, we used molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize heterostructures formed by stacking together two magnetic materials, a ferromagnetic topological insulator (TI) and an antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide (FeTe). We observed emergent interface-induced superconductivity in these heterostructures and demonstrated the co-occurrence of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and topological band structure in the magnetic TI layer—the three essential ingredients of chiral topological superconductivity (TSC). The unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity is accompanied by a high upper critical magnetic field that exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit for conventional superconductors at low temperatures. These magnetic TI/FeTe heterostructures with robust superconductivity and atomically sharp interfaces provide an ideal wafer-scale platform for the exploration of chiral TSC and Majorana physics. One of the recipes for realizing topological superconductivity calls for interfacing a topological insulator with a superconductor. In a variant of that approach, Yi et al. grew a heterostructure consisting of layers of a magnetic topological insulator, (Bi,Sb)2Te3 doped with chromium, and antiferromagnetic iron telluride. Neither of these materials is superconducting, but iron telluride is a parent compound for a family of iron-based superconductors. Interfacing the layers led to the appearance of superconductivity in the presence of ferromagnetism and topological band structure. This combination of properties makes the heterostructure a promising, although not yet proven, platform for observing chiral topological superconductivity. —Jelena Stajic Superconductivity was induced by interfacing a magnetic topological insulator with antiferromagnetic iron telluride.}
