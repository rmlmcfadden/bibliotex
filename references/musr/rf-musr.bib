   abstract = "RF excitation was first used in $\mu$SR in 1958 [1]. However, even with the advent of modern meson facilities the use of RF techniques in $\mu$SR has not flourished, in part due to the muon's short lifetime, but mainly because unlike NMR RF fields are simply not used to detect the muon's polarization. Nevertheless, a cursory survey of the relative power and sophistication of these two related fields leaves little doubt that the pursuit of RF resonance within $\mu$SR will add significantly to its analytical capability. At TRIUMF over the past few years we have worked toward developing RF capabilities suitable for use in a CW meson facility. Several spectroscopic applications utilizing time integral techniques have been tested. These include detection of final states in semiconductor and substituted radical systems, the very pretty two photon absorption (TPA) experiments, and the use of low field swept frequency excitation to measure nuclear hyperfine parameters in Mu like system. Of course, the most celebrated use of RF in magnetic resonance is its application to spin dynamics via various spin echo techniques. The adaptation of the spin echo to $\mu$SR is discussed and examples of both transverse and longitudinal field echoes are presented.",

   abstract = "This paper explores the use of pulsed radio-frequency (RF) techniques to remove the frequency limitations imposed on conventional transverse muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments at a pulsed muon source by the finite muon pulse width. The implementation of the 90{\textdegree} pulse technique is demonstrated by observing the free precession signal of diamagnetic muons implanted in polythene, the change in signal amplitude as a function of RF pulse length is plotted and the precise condition for a 90{\textdegree} pulse determined. The technique is evaluated by comparing measurements made using conventional spin rotation experiments to those employing pulsed RF methods. The potential for applying standard NMR multiple-pulse methods to the $\mu$SR experiment is considered and the use of two-pulse RF sequences (90{\textdegree}x−$\tau$−90{\textdegree}xand 90{\textdegree}x−$\tau$−180{\textdegree}x) to form a muon spin echo demonstrated.",
