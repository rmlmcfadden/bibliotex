   abstract = "A package for analysing Î¼SR data has been developed for the PC running Microsoft Windows operating systems (Windows 95, 98 and NT4). Some of the key points considered in the design of the program were that it should run on a typical Windows PC, that it should directly read the binary files produced by muon data acquisition systems, that it should be equally easy to analyse data on-line and off-line and that appropriate features should be included for both pulsed and continuous muon sources."
