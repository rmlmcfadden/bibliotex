   abstract = "The technique of muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) is described, with examples of its application in the fields of chemistry and solid state physics. It is shown how the raw experimental data contains information about the evolution of the spin polarization of muons stopped in matter. Fourier transformation provides a means of extracting the precession frequencies characteristic of various muonic species. Some manipulation of the raw data is essential to ensure accurate representation of the frequency information, and further techniques are often used to improve the final spectrum. These are discussed, and some examples are given of their effects. This is followed by descriptions of specific applications of Fourier transform $\mu$SR in the study of the light hydrogen isotope muoniun (Mu = $\mu$+e−), muonium-substituted free radicals, and paramagnetic states of the $\mu$+ in solids.",
