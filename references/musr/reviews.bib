When it is implanted in condensed matter, the evolution of its spin polarisation may be readily monitored to give information on the crystallographic or molecular sites it occupies, the local fields it experiences and the time dependence of these fields. This article describes the experimental techniques in current use, and the manner in which the muon behaviour is characterised. The implications for solid state and chemical physics are discussed. The comparison between muon and proton behaviour in similar circumstances is emphasised. For chemical aspects, the equivalent comparison is between muonium and hydrogen, with muonium considered as a radioactive light isotope. Examples of studies are reviewed for magnetic materials, for metals and metal hydrides, for semiconductors and ionic crystals, and for certain organic materials and liquids. Novel information is obtained on topics including spin dynamics, dynamic correlations and critical phenomena, the localisation and quantum mobility of light interstitial particles, charge screening, the local electronic structure of hydrogen-like defect centres, hyperfine interactions, various kinetic and dynamic isotope effects and the role of vibrational effects, including zero-point motion, in determining molecular structure. Comparisons are drawn with studies by other techniques, notably magnetic resonance. Techniques and applications appropriate to pulsed muon sources are considered. The major achievements to date and the potential for future developments and new science are identified.}

The magnetic properties of certain materials as collected by different methods and techniques are focused in the chapter. The application of μSR-spectroscopy has added to the understanding of established magnetic phenomena. However, when using positive muons (μ+) μSR spectroscopy has shown the potential to uncover new and unexpected magnetic features owing to its high sensitivity to small magnetic fields and spatially inhomogeneous properties. Thus μSR-spectroscopy is most powerful in the field of small moment magnetism and in all instances when magnetic order is of a random or short range nature and where neutron scattering will fail. The μSR-spectroscopy also works in the case of broad lines and short relaxation rates. The local probe aspect of μSR and its sensitivity to inhomogeneous features has brought the real nature of solids into light that are never perfect in lattice structure, stoichiometry, and morphology; and hence also magnetic properties do not show up in an ideal manner. To perform μSR measurements, positive muons have to be implanted into the material of interest."

Muonium in semiconductors is studied using a set of complementary methods that are collectively referred to as “μSR,” an acronym for muon spin relaxation, rotation, and resonance. The structure and properties of isolated atomic hydrogenin semiconductors have been under intense investigation in recent years. The studies of muonium in semiconductors may be classified under one of the two categories: electronic structure or dynamics. Experiments on the former are concerned with the crystalline site of the muon, any possible rearrangement of the neighboring atoms, and the surrounding electronic density (or unpaired electronic spin density in the case of paramagnetic centers). As in the related forms of magnetic spin resonance, information on structure is extracted from the relevant spin interactions (i.e., the muon and nuclear hyperfine interactions, muon-nuclear dipolar interactions, and nuclear-electric quadrupole interactions). Despite extensive knowledge of the interactions with the neighbors, the site of the muon is still ambiguous. However, with a few reasonable assumptions based on theory and common sense, all but one site can be ruled out."

In over two decades a quite substantial body of μSR data has been collected from rare-earth and actinide materials, the latter, however, mostly restricted to samples containing uranium. μSR is the measurement of the temporal development of the spatial orientation of the spins of muons, which have been implanted in the material of interest with all spins initially fixed in one direction (complete muon spin polarization). μSR can be performed either with positive or negative muons. The latter behave like heavy electrons and will be captured into Bohr orbits by the atoms in the sample material. They will quickly reach the ls ground state, whose orbital radius, however, is comparable to nuclear radii. Negative muons thus sense predominantly the effects of the protonic charge distribution and the result is primarily of interest to nuclear physics. The magnetic field at the site of the muon in a magnetic compound is, at least in part, created by the dipole moments on neighboring paramagnetic atoms or ions."

By comparison of µSR measurements of the vortex core size in a variety of materials with results from techniques that directly probe electronic states, the effect of delocalized quasiparticles on the spatial variation of field in a lattice of interacting vortices has been determined for both single-band and multi-band superconductors. These studies demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of what some still consider an exotic technique. In recent years µSR has also been used to search for magnetism in and around the vortex cores of high-temperature superconductors. As a local probe µSR is specially suited for detecting static or quasistatic magnetism having short-range or random spatial correlations. As discussed in this review, µSR experiments support a generic phase diagram of competing superconducting and magnetic order parameters, characterized by a quantum phase transition to a state where the competing order is spatially nonuniform.}

  abstract = {Although the interstitial hydrogen atom would seem to be one of the simplest defect centres in any lattice, its solid state chemistry is in fact unknown in many materials, not least amongst the elements.
In semiconductors, the realization that hydrogen can profoundly influence electronic properties even as a trace impurity has prompted its study by all available means—but still only in the functionally important or potentially important materials—for the elements, Si, Ge and diamond.
Even here, it was not studies of hydrogen itself but of its pseudo-isotope, muonium, that first provided the much needed microscopic pictures of crystallographic site and local electronic structure—now comprehensively confirmed by ab initio computation and such data as exists for monatomic, interstitial hydrogen centres in Si.
Muonium can be formed in a variety of neutral paramagnetic states when positive muons are implanted into non-metals.
The simple trapped atom is commonly only metastable.
It coexists with or reacts to give defect centres with the unpaired electron in somewhat more extended orbitals.
Indications of complete delocalization into effective mass states are discussed for B, α-Sn, Bi and even Ge, but otherwise all the muonium centres seen in the elemental semiconductors are deep and relatively compact.
These are revealed, distinguished and characterized by μSR spectroscopy—muon spin rotation and resonance informing on sites and spin-density distributions, muon spin relaxation on motional dynamics and charge-state transitions. This Report documents the progress of μSR studies for all the semiconductors and semimetals of the p-block elements, Groups III–VI of the Periodic Table.
The striking spectra and originally unanticipated results for Group IV are for the most part well known but deserve summarizing and updating; the sheer diversity of muonium states found is still remarkable, especially in carbon allotropes.
The interplay of crystallographic site and charge state in Si and Ge at high temperatures, or under illumination, reflects the capture and loss of charge carriers that should model the electrical activity of monatomic hydrogen but still challenges theoretical descriptions.
Spin–flip scattering of conduction electrons by the paramagnetic centres is revealed in heavily doped n-type material, as well as some modification of the local electronic structures.
The corresponding spectroscopy for the solid elements of Groups III, V and VI is rather less well known and is reviewed here for the first time; a good deal of previously unpublished data is also included.
Theoretical expectations and computational modelling are sparse, here.
Recent results for B suggest a relatively shallow centre with molecular character; P and As show deeper quasi-atomic states, but still with substantial overlap of spin density onto surrounding host atoms. 
Particular attention is paid to the chalcogens.
Muonium centres in Te show charge-state transitions already around room temperature; the identification of those in S and Se has been complicated by unusual spin dynamics of a different character, here attributed to spin–orbit coupling and interstitial reorientation.
In the metals and semimetals, muonium is not formed as a paramagnetic centre.
Here the implanted muons mimic interstital protons and interest shifts to a variety of other topics, including aspects of charge screening (α-Sn, Sb, Bi), site preference and quantum mobility (Al, β-Sn, Pb).
The post-transition metals receive only a brief mention, by way of contrast with the nonmetals.
Systematic studies of local susceptibility via measurements of muon Knight shifts extends in favourable cases to revealing the elusive high-field Condon domains (Al, Sn, Pb, Bi).
Some new information is available on the superconducting phases.
Appendices include a derivation of the spin Hamiltonian for paramagnetic muonium centres or molecular radicals having varying admixtures of orbital angular momentum, including the extreme case of orbital degeneracy, and examine the consequences of significant spin–orbit coupling for μSR spectroscopy and muon spin relaxation.
This is the framework for the tentative assignments made here for the muonium defect centres formed in sulphur and selenium, namely diatomic species resembling the chalcogen monohydrides.
Equally, it provides guidelines for eventual solid-state detection of OMu—the elusive muoniated hydroxyl radical.}

At the present time this spectroscopy hasgiven access to detailed information (often unobtainable with other means), on a largenumber of magnetic, semiconducting and superconducting systems, but the present articledeals with another aspect of $\mu$SR, namely the information it could provide on how alight positive particle behaves when placed in a metallic environment. This behaviour hasmuch in common with that of the technologically important ``hydrogen in metal''-problem, butcould now be studied in a very direct way since the positive muon is radioactive and sendsout an easily detectable signal. This signal contains information on the particle's localenvironment, its motion from one lattice position to another, its trapping and releasefrom other impurity atoms in the metal and also on the character of the motion itself,particularly at low temperatures where quantum effects dominate. It took nearly 15 yearsto fully interpret and understand these phenomena which is the topic of the presenthistoric presentation.",

The final section is concerned with spin dynamics and magnetism in soft materials, and starts with discussing many of the key results in molecular magnets and organic spintronics. Spin dynamics in organic semiconductors, polymers and biological molecules is then covered, where contradictory experimental and theoretical work on charge carrier motion is presented.
