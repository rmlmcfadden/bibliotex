	journal = {J. Phys.: Condens. Matter},
	% abstract = {A detailed analysis of muon-spin rotation (μSR) spectra in the vortex state of type-II superconductors using different theoretical models is presented. Analytical approximations of the London and Ginzburg–Landau (GL) models, as well as an exact solution of the GL model were used. The limits of the validity of these models and the reliability for extracting parameters such as the magnetic penetration depth λ and the coherence length ξ from the experimental μSR  spectra were investigated. The analysis of the simulated μSR  spectra showed that at high magnetic fields there is a strong correlation between λ  and ξ  obtained for any value of the Ginzburg–Landau parameter κ = λ/ξ. The smaller the applied magnetic field, the smaller the possibility of finding the correct value of ξ. A simultaneous determination of λ  and ξ  without any restrictions is very problematic, regardless of the model used to describe the vortex state. It was found that for extreme type-II superconductors and low magnetic fields, the fitted value of λ is practically independent of ξ. The second-moment method frequently used to analyze μSR  spectra by means of a multi-component Gaussian fit generally yields reliable values of λ  over the whole range of applied fields  (Hc1  and Hc2  are the first and second critical fields, respectively). These results are also relevant for the interpretation of small-angle neutron scattering experiments on the vortex state in type-II superconductors.}

	journal = {New J. Phys.},
	abstract = {Topological superconductivity is an exotic phenomenon due to the symmetry-protected topological surface state, in which a quantum system has an energy gap in the bulk but supports gapless excitations confined to its boundary. Symmetries including central and time-reversal symmetry (TRS), along with their relations with topology, are crucial for topological superconductivity. We report muon spin relaxation/rotation (μSR) experiments on a topological noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe2 to study its TRS and gap symmetry. Zero-field μSR experiments indicate the absence of internal magnetic field in the superconducting state, consistent with previous μSR results. Furthermore, transverse-field μSR measurements reveals that the superconducting gap of PbTaSe2 is an isotropic three-dimensional fully-gapped single-band. The fully-gapped results can help understand the pairing mechanism and further classify the topological superconductivity in this system.}
