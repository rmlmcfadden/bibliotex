	abstract = {The asymmetry signal of a μSR time histogram is theoretically the Fourier transform of the local field distribution P(b), for samples with static local fields. Commonly, P(b) is extracted from the time histograms by either a fast Fourier transform (FFT) or maximum entropy (ME). In this paper, we discuss how ME suppresses noise, and directly compare ME line shapes with FFTs.}

	abstract = {The asymmetry signal of a transverse field μSR time histogram is primarily the Fourier transform of the local field distribution P(b) for samples with static local fields b. The maximum entropy technique is used to produce a μSR lineshape which automatically deconvolutes the pulse structure of the beam (for pulsed facilities) and the time window. In this paper, we describe how to combine several component kernels to construct the transformation matrix for converting the lineshape into a time signal. We discuss the implications for improving the μSR maximum entropy (ME) algorithm under certain circumstances, and how dipolar broadening might be deconvoluted safely. This transformation may also be used to create accurate theoretical time signals for conventional fitting.}

	abstract = {In muon spin rotation (μSR) measurements, the details of the local field distribution P(b) are of interest, so either a fast Fourier transform (FFT) or the maximum entropy method (MEM) is applied to extract P(b) from the μSR time spectra. Ideally, one would like to analyze the resulting P(b) as if it were a data set in its own right: fitting P(b) to appropriate theoretical functions and calculating its mean, second moment and third moment. This is only possible if there are rigorous errors associated with P(b). In this paper, we show that the maximum entropy method finds its maximum in a way analogous to χ2 fitting. Calculation of a covariance matrix naturally follows. The covariance matrix demonstrates that the maximum entropy (ME) result P(b) has intrinsically correlated, not independent, errors. With proper care, P(b) can be fit and have its moments calculated. This method is not limited to μSR applications, it can be applied to other cases involving Fourier transforms of data, such as NMR.}

	abstract = {The maximum entropy (ME) analysis of μSR time spectra is used to produce the local field distribution P(b). The ME technique has user-defined constants in addition to the usual data manipulation parameters (such as the time range and binning) used in traditional fitting or Fourier transforms. The ME constants are the default level (used to suppress signals below the noise level) and a looseness factor (used to smooth the line shape). In this paper, we discuss how to automatically select values for these constants to ensure that the resulting P(b) is minimally distorted from the ideal and that the calculated errors are sensible.}
