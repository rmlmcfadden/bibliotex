The main emphasis is directed toward the rotational diffusive motion, assumed to be isotropic, which is treated with the stochastic Liouville formalism. Inter-resonance interactions, electron and chemical relaxation effects are incorporated using a multistate version of the strong collision model, derived from the above formalism in the appropriate spin space. A central finding of the calculation concerns the role of the inter-resonance interactions. It will be shown that over the range where dynamical mechanisms broaden the ΔM = 1 ALCR line to the extent that there is overlap with the ΔM = 0, 2 lines, then these transitions are strongly supressed."

This work is exclusively concerned with the band associated with the ΔM = 1 transition, the form of which is found to be highly dependent upon the nature of the dynamic behaviour of the radical. Various types of stochastic motion are considered. It is shown that spherical averaging of the muon anisotropy instigates a broadening of the resonance and ultimately, the loss of any meaningful intensity. Any motion which gives rise to residual anisotropy will be manifested by residual intensity at the central band position. Spectral simulations are compared with previous simulations, calculated using the stochastic Liouville formalism, and related to experimental data."

	abstract = {Although muons are primarily regarded as a local spin probe, they can also access the charge state of an atom or molecule via quadrupolar level crossing resonance (QLCR) spectroscopy. We use Li+TCNQ– (TCNQ = 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane), a simple charge transfer salt, to test the potential of this technique in molecular systems by studying the interaction of a positive muon with the TCNQ nitrogen atoms. We show that both a positive muon and muonium are able to add to the nitrogen, leading to a singlet spin state for the addition molecule. This produces a characteristic three line QLCR spectrum, with the observed line positions and intensities determined by the principal values and orientation of the electric field gradient tensor at the nitrogen. Ab initio calculation of this field gradient and the resulting QLCR spectrum give good agreement with the experiment. A nonresonant background contribution to the relaxation rate also provides evidence for spin excitations rapidly diffusing along the TCNQ chains. These reflect mobile unpaired electrons introduced by muonium addition. It is thus shown that a single set of muon measurements can be sensitive to both spin and charge degrees of freedom in the same molecular material.}

The resulting avoided level crossing resonance observed as a function of magnetic field provides a means of studying these interactions and understanding the effect of the electric-field gradient due to the muon acting on the quadrupolar nuclei. The effect is usually modelled by considering the interaction between the positive muon and a single copper nucleus, but the other five copper nuclei are equally important. By solving the problem in the full 2(2I + 1)6 = 8192-dimensional Hilbert space, we demonstrate the effect of these additional interactions.}
