Isotopic spectra for cyclohexadienyl radicals adsorbed on SiO2 are explained by translational diffusion around the 7 nm grain.

Analytical results are presented for integral μSR experiments and for the on-resonance time differential case. The effects of incorporating a first-order chemical reaction are also briefly presented."

The main emphasis is directed toward the rotational diffusive motion, assumed to be isotropic, which is treated with the stochastic Liouville formalism. Inter-resonance interactions, electron and chemical relaxation effects are incorporated using a multistate version of the strong collision model, derived from the above formalism in the appropriate spin space. A central finding of the calculation concerns the role of the inter-resonance interactions. It will be shown that over the range where dynamical mechanisms broaden the ΔM = 1 ALCR line to the extent that there is overlap with the ΔM = 0, 2 lines, then these transitions are strongly supressed."

   abstract = "Spectral simulations of the dynamic avoided level-crossing muon spin resonance response , calculated using Monte Carlo methods, are presented. This work is exclusively concerned with the band associated with the ΔM = 1 transition, the form of which is found to be highly dependent upon the nature of the dynamic behaviour of the radical. Various types of stochastic motion are considered. It is shown that spherical averaging of the muon anisotropy instigates a broadening of the resonance and ultimately, the loss of any meaningful intensity. Any motion which gives rise to residual anisotropy will be manifested by residual intensity at the central band position. Spectral simulations are compared with previous simulations, calculated using the stochastic Liouville formalism, and related to experimental data."
