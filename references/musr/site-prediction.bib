	abstract = {We present the calculation of anomalous muonium in silicon which has been extensively studied but there still remains unresolved problems in the first-principles calculations. We perform calculations using spin-polarized density functional theory within the general gradient approximation or the local density approximation. We check the size effect of supercells and find that we need to use large sizes of supercells to obtain reliable results. Some quantitative disagreement between the experimental and theoretical values in previous studies may be due to the use of insufficient sizes of supercells. We clarify that the negative Fermi contact interaction constant (FCIC) is induced by the electron correlation effect. By using the Hubbard model, we find that the FCIC is zero when we neglect the correlation effect and the negative value of the FCIC is induced by the correlation effect.}

	abstract = {We present UNDI, an open-source program to analyze the time dependent spin polarization of an isolated muon interacting with the surrounding nuclear magnetic dipoles in the context of standard muon spin rotation and relaxation spectroscopy experiments. The code can perform both exact and approximated estimates of the muon polarization function in presence of external fields and electric field gradients on the nuclei surrounding the muon. We show that this tool, combined to ab initio estimations of the electric field gradient at the nuclei interacting with the muon, can become a valuable complement to supercell based identifications of muon sites in crystals when large nuclear magnetic moments are present in the sample. In addition, it allows to properly investigate physical properties influenced by the presence of a non-negligible electric field gradient such as avoided level crossing resonance, nature of the ground state, disentanglement of electronic and nuclear magnetic moments or charge ordered states. The efficiency and effectiveness of this method is shown along the lines of three realistic examples.

Solution method: A python library that provides a set of tools to efficiently solve the spin Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the muon and its neighboring nuclei. The code provides the time development of the spin polarization of the muon subject to external fields and accounts for quadrupolar interactions at the nuclear sites. The solution is sought at quantum level accuracy and Hilbert spaces with dimension up to one million can be handled, thus providing accurate results for all standard experimental conditions.}

The technique aims to address two of the most common criticisms of the muon-spin spectroscopy (μ+SR) technique, namely, where in the sample does the muon stop, and what is its effect on its local environment. We have designed and developed a program called MuFinder that enables users to carry out these calculations through a simple graphical user interface (GUI). The procedure for calculating muon sites by generating initial muon positions, relaxing the structures, and then clustering and analysing the resulting candidate sites, can be done entirely within the GUI. The local magnetic field at the muon site can also be computed, allowing the connection between the muon sites obtained and experiment to be made. MuFinder will make these computations significantly more accessible to non-experts and help to establish muon site calculations as a routine part of μ+SR experiments.

Electronic structure calculations are of paramount importance for providing this understanding, particularly through a group of techniques that has become known as DFT, density functional theory including the presence of the implanted muon.
