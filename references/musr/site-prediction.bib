   abstract = {The most fundamental limitations of a muon-spin relaxation experiment can be the lack of knowledge of the implantation site of the muon and the uncertainty about the muon's perturbation of its host. Here we review some of the work done on the ‘muon site problem’ in the solid state and highlight some recent applications of electronic structure calculations that have successfully characterized the quantum states of muons in a number of insulating compounds containing fluorine, in a number of pnictide superconductors, and in ZnO.}

	abstract = {We present the calculation of anomalous muonium in silicon which has been extensively studied but there still remains unresolved problems in the first-principles calculations. We perform calculations using spin-polarized density functional theory within the general gradient approximation or the local density approximation. We check the size effect of supercells and find that we need to use large sizes of supercells to obtain reliable results. Some quantitative disagreement between the experimental and theoretical values in previous studies may be due to the use of insufficient sizes of supercells. We clarify that the negative Fermi contact interaction constant (FCIC) is induced by the electron correlation effect. By using the Hubbard model, we find that the FCIC is zero when we neglect the correlation effect and the negative value of the FCIC is induced by the correlation effect.}
