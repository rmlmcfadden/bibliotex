	abstract = {We propose a model to describe the fluctuations in the internal magnetic field due to ion dynamics observed in muon spin relaxation (μSR) by an Edwards–Anderson-type autocorrelation function that separates the quasi-static and dynamic components of the correlation by the parameter Q (where 0 ≤ Q ≤ 1). Our Monte Carlo simulations for this model showed that the time evolution of muon spin polarization deviates significantly from the Kubo–Toyabe function. To further validate the model, the results of simulations were compared with the μSR spectra observed in a hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite FAPbI3 [with FA referring to HC(NH2)2], where local field fluctuations associated with the rotational motion of FA molecules and quasi-static fields from the PbI3 lattice are presumed to coexist. The least-squares curve fitting showed reasonable agreement with the model with Q = 0.947(3), and the fluctuation frequency of the dynamical component was obtained. This result opens the door to the possibility of experimentally distinguishing fluctuations due to the dynamics of ions around muons from those due to the self-diffusion of muons. On the other hand, it suggests the need to carefully consider the spin relaxation function when applying μSR to the issue of ion dynamics.}

A departure from the widely used Kubo–Toyabe function is expected to be observed in an important thermal region.}
