	% abstract = "{This study outlines a concept that would leverage the existing proton accelerator at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory to enable transformative science via one world-class facility serving two missions: Single Event Effects (SEE) and Muon Spectroscopy (μSR). The μSR portion would deliver the world’s highest flux and highest resolution pulsed muon beams for material characterization purposes, with precision and capabilities well beyond comparable facilities. The SEE capabilities deliver neutron, proton, and muon beams for aerospace industries that are facing an impending challenge to certify equipment for safe and reliable behavior under bombardment from atmospheric radiation originating from cosmic and solar rays. With negligible impact on the primary neutron scattering mission of the SNS, the proposed facility will have enormous benefits for both science and industry. We have designated this facility “SEEMS.”}",
