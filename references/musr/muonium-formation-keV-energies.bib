	% abstract = {Charge differentiation in μ+ or muonium (Mu) as a consequence of the slowing down of μ+ in matter is of fundamental interest in the μSR method. It is also of relevance for understanding the moderation process of μ+ in van der Waals solids like s-Ne, s-Ar or s-N2, which are the most suitable materials to generate epithermal μ+ serving as a source for low-energy μ+ (LE-μ+) beams. The LE-μ+ beam at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) allows us to study the formation of Mu at low implantation energies (0.5–30keV) in insulators and semiconductors. These investigations may help to clarify the interaction between the μ+ and the electrons of its ionisation track since the number of track electrons can be tuned by varying the implantation energy. We present the first results of LE-μSR investigations on thin van der Waals solids (s-Ar, s-Xe), fused quartz (SUPRASIL) and a quartz crystal, where the μ+ and Mu fractions were measured as a function of the implantation energy.}
