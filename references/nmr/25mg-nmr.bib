These changes are not the result of changes in the bulk magnetic susceptibility of the samples, but may be due to increased orbital overlap which is the result of the increase in thermal vibration of the ions with temperature. In the case of 25Mg, the shift to lower shielding with increasing temperature is opposite to that expected from simple bond length versus chemical shift trends established for the oxides at room temperature. If this is a general phenomenon, high-temperature NMR data may be biased to lower shielding.",

To constrain the determination of the NMR interaction parameters (δiso, χQ, ηQ) data have been collected at three external magnetic fields (11.7, 14.1 and 18.8 T). Corresponding NMR parameters have also been calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) methods using the GIPAW approach, with good correlations being established between experimental and calculated values of both χQ and δiso. These correlations demonstrate that the 25Mg NMR parameters are very sensitive to the structure, with small changes in the local Mg2+ environment and the overall hydration state profoundly affecting the observed spectra. The observations suggest that 25Mg NMR spectroscopy is a potentially potent probe for addressing some key problems in inorganic materials and of metal centres in biologically relevant molecules.},

In this work at an ultrahigh magnetic field of 21.1 T{,} we have studied at natural abundance the 25Mg solid state (SS) NMR spectra for a number of previously unreported magnesium compounds with known crystal structures. Some previously reported compounds have been revisited to clarify the spectra that were obtained at lower fields and were either not sufficiently resolved{,} or misinterpreted. First principles calculations of the 25Mg SS NMR parameters have been carried out using plane wave basis sets and periodic boundary conditions (CASTEP) and the results are compared with experimental data. The calculations produce the 25Mg absolute shielding scale and give us insight into the relationship between the NMR and structural parameters. At 21.1 T the effects of the quadrupolar interactions are reduced significantly and the sensitivity and accuracy in determining chemicals shifts and quadrupole coupling parameters improve dramatically. Although T1 measurements were not performed explicitly{,} these proved to be longer than assumed in much of the previously reported work. We demonstrate that the chemical shift range of magnesium in diamagnetic compounds may approach 200 ppm. Most commonly{,} however{,} the observed shifts are between -15 and +25 ppm. Quadrupolar effects dominate the 25Mg spectra of magnesium cations in non-cubic environments. The chemical shift anisotropy appears to be rather small and only in a few cases could the contribution of the CSA be detected reliably. A good correspondence between the calculated shielding constants and experimental chemical shifts was obtained{,} demonstrating the good potential of computational methods in spectroscopic assignments of solid state 25Mg NMR spectroscopy."

   abstract = "Rechargeable battery systems based on Mg-ion chemistries are generating significant interest as potential alternatives to Li-ion batteries. Despite the wealth of local structural information that could potentially be gained from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments of Mg-ion battery materials{,} systematic 25Mg solid-state NMR studies have been scarce due to the low natural abundance{,} low gyromagnetic ratio{,} and significant quadrupole moment of 25Mg (I = 5/2). This work reports a combined experimental 25Mg NMR and first principles density functional theory (DFT) study of paramagnetic Mg transition metal oxide systems Mg6MnO8 and MgCr2O4 that serve as model systems for Mg-ion battery cathode materials. Magnetic parameters{,} hyperfine shifts and quadrupolar parameters were calculated ab initio using hybrid DFT and compared to the experimental values obtained from NMR and magnetic measurements. We show that the rotor assisted population transfer (RAPT) pulse sequence can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in paramagnetic 25Mg spectra without distortions in the spinning sideband manifold. In addition{,} the value of the predicted quadrupolar coupling constant of Mg6MnO8 was confirmed using the RAPT pulse sequence. We further apply the same methodology to study the NMR spectra of spinel compounds MgV2O4 and MgMn2O4{,} candidate cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries."

   abstract = "We present a review of recent advances in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) studies of exotic nuclei. Exotic nuclei may be spin-1/2 or quadrupolar, and typically have low gyromagnetic ratios, low natural abundances, large quadrupole moments (when I > 1/2), or some combination of these properties, generally resulting in low receptivities and/or prohibitively broad line widths. Some nuclides are little studied for other reasons, also rendering them somewhat exotic. We first discuss some of the recent progress in pulse sequences and hardware development which continues to enable researchers to study new kinds of materials as well as previously unfeasible nuclei. This is followed by a survey of applications to a wide range of exotic nuclei (including e.g., 9Be, 25Mg, 33S, 39K, 43Ca, 47/49Ti, 53Cr, 59Co, 61Ni, 67Zn, 73Ge, 75As, 87Sr, 115In, 119Sn, 121/123Sb, 135/137Ba, 185/187Re, 209Bi), most of them quadrupolar. The scope of the review is the past ten years, i.e., 2007–2017."

   abstract = "There is increasing evidence that the solvation structure of the active components in a liquid electrolyte solution strongly impacts the performance in electrochemical applications. In this work, the nanoscale solvation structures and dynamics of Mg(BH4)2 and Mg(TFSI)2 dissolved in diglyme (DGM) at various concentrations and ratios of Mg(BH4)2/Mg(TFSI)2 were investigated using a combination of natural abundance 25Mg NMR, quantum chemistry calculations of 25Mg NMR chemical shifts, classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, and electrochemical performance tests. By mixing two competing Mg salts, we were able to reduce the strong covalent interactions between Mg2+ and BH4– anions. A small increase is observed in the coordination number of Mg-TFSI and a significant increase in the interaction of Mg2+ ions with glymes. Through a combination of NMR, DFT and MD simulations, various stable species around 1 nm in size were detected in the mixed salt solution, which play key roles in the enhanced electrochemical performance of the mixed electrolyte. It is established that for the neat Mg(TFSI)2 in DGM electrolyte at dilute concentrations the TFSI- is fully dissociated from Mg2+. At higher concentrations, Mg2+ and TFSI- are only partially dissociated as contact ion pairs are formed. In contrast, at 0.01 M Mg(BH4)2 (saturated concentration) in DGM, the first solvation shell of a Mg2+ ion contains two BH4- anions and one DGM molecule, while the second solvation shell consists of five to six DGM molecules. An exchange mechanism between the solvation structures in the combined electrolyte containing both Mg(BH4)2 and Mg(TFSI)2 in DGM was found to result in the observation of a single 25Mg NMR peak. This exchange is responsible for an increase in uncoordinated anions, as well as improved stability and ionic conductivity as compared to single anion solution. Solvent molecule rearrangement and direct Mg-ion exchange between the basic solvation structures are hypothesized as likely reasons for the exchange. We elucidate that the solvent rearrangement is energetically much more favorable than direct Mg-ion hopping and is thus suggested as the dominant exchange mechanism."
