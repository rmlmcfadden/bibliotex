    abstract = {Whereas high resolution NMR at temperatures up to 550 K can be routinely performed selecting from a variety of commercially available NMR hardware, experiments in the high temperature regime, defined here as T > 550 K, have been restricted to just a few specialized laboratories. In this contribution we present important developments of high temperature NMR over the last decades. Various methods to achieve high resolution high temperature NMR, including resistive heating, laser-assisted heating and inductive heating, are presented and their specific advantages and disadvantages discussed. The various ways of temperature monitoring including the use of chemical shift thermometers or T1 thermometers are reviewed. In the last section, some typical application examples from the field of oxidic glasses and melts are given.}
