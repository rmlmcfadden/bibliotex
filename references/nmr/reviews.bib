   abstract = "Nuclear spin relaxation has been developed as a standard method for studying molecular motions in liquids, solids, polymers, and---to a lesser extent---gases, staring with the pioneering work of Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound [1]. Of the great variety of molecular motions possible (e.g., translations, rotations, vibrations) rotations are particularly important for nuclear spin relaxation. Conversely, nuclear spin relaxation can be especially successful if information about rotational motions is desired. In this case nuclear spin relaxation can yield quantitative information over an extraordinary wide range of characteristic frequencies, from about 1 Hz to 1014Hz. It shoud be noted that, typically, the nuclear spin relaxation times actually observed are much longer than the characteristic times of rotation of molecules. Therefore, a theory is needed which links the time constants of nuclear spin relaxation to the correlation functions describing the rotational motion, and so a considerable part of this volume is devoted to this goal. For rapid motions in liquids of low viscosity nuclear spin relaxation thus in principle, is inferior to scattering experiments (e.g., light and neutron scattering) which allow the determination of correlation functions.",

Structural and dynamic information was obtained from wideline, high-resolution and relaxation studies. Nuclei of both guest species and host lattices were used as probes for their environment. NMR techniques provided adequate tools for studying the location of guest molecules, their orientation and bonding characteristics as well as guest-host interactions and details of the motional behaviour. Physical properties have been investigated, and by close interaction between synthesis and spectroscopic measurements, NMR was conducive to the development of the chemistry of intercalation as well. In several cases NMR has even turned out to be a highly useful analytical tool.",

   abstract = {Improving electrochemical energy storage is one of the major issues of our time. The search for new battery materials together with the drive to improve performance and lower cost of existing and new batteries is not without its challenges. Success in these matters is undoubtedly based on first understanding the underlying chemistries of the materials and the relations between the components involved. A combined application of experimental and theoretical techniques has proven to be a powerful strategy to gain insights into many of the questions that arise from the “how do batteries work and why do they fail” challenge. In this Review, we highlight the application of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in battery research: a technique that can be extremely powerful in characterizing local structures in battery materials, even in highly disordered systems. An introduction on electrochemical energy storage illustrates the research aims and prospective approaches to reach these. We particularly address “NMR in battery research” by giving a brief introduction to electrochemical techniques and applications as well as background information on both in and ex situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We will try to answer the question “Is NMR suitable and how can it help me to solve my problem?” by shortly reviewing some of our recent research on electrodes, microstructure formation, electrolytes and interfaces, in which the application of NMR was helpful. Finally, we share hands-on experience directly from the lab bench to answer the fundamental question “Where and how should I start?” to help guide a researcher’s way through the manifold possible approaches.}

   abstract = "The field of paramagnetic NMR has expanded considerably in recent years. This review addresses both the theoretical description of paramagnetic NMR, and the way in which it is currently practised. We provide a review of the theory of the NMR parameters of systems in both solution and the solid state. Here we unify the different languages used by the NMR, EPR, quantum chemistry/DFT, and magnetism communities to provide a comprehensive and coherent theoretical description. We cover the theory of the paramagnetic shift and shift anisotropy in solution both in the traditional formalism in terms of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, and using a more modern formalism employing the relevant EPR parameters, such as are used in first-principles calculations. In addition we examine the theory first in the simple non-relativistic picture, and then in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. These ideas are then extended to a description of the paramagnetic shift in periodic solids, where it is necessary to include the bulk magnetic properties, such as magnetic ordering at low temperatures. The description of the paramagnetic shift is completed by describing the current understanding of such shifts due to lanthanide and actinide ions. We then examine the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, using a simple model employing a phenomenological picture of the electronic relaxation, and again using a more complex state-of-the-art theory which incorporates electronic relaxation explicitly. An additional important consideration in the solid state is the impact of bulk magnetic susceptibility effects on the form of the spectrum, where we include some ideas from the field of classical electrodynamics. We then continue by describing in detail the solution and solid-state NMR methods that have been deployed in the study of paramagnetic systems in chemistry, biology, and the materials sciences. Finally we describe a number of case studies in paramagnetic NMR that have been specifically chosen to highlight how the theory in part one, and the methods in part two, can be used in practice. The systems chosen include small organometallic complexes in solution, solid battery electrode materials, metalloproteins in both solution and the solid state, systems containing lanthanide ions, and multi-component materials used in pharmaceutical controlled-release formulations that have been doped with paramagnetic species to measure the component domain sizes."

However, reports in the literature of similar studies on inorganic glass-forming liquids have remained somewhat limited due to the experimental challenges. In this contribution we present a review of the high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies of atomic and molecular dynamics in a wide variety of inorganic glass-forming liquids including oxides, halides and chalcogenides as well as select ionic liquids and molten salts. The significance of these dynamical processes in understanding the nature of the liquid-to-glass transition and their connection with the macroscopic transport properties of these liquids are discussed.}
