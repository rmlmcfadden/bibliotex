	% abstract = {Abstract The shielding tensor and the chemical shift tensor are not necessarily symmetric, and in general they have both symmetric and antisymmetric parts. The antisymmetric part (not to be confused with the anisotropy of the symmetric part) does not give rise to an observable shift, even in the solid phase, but it does cause relaxation. The antisymmetric part of the shielding tensor can be considered in its corresponding axial vector form, and this allows the effect of symmetry at a nuclear site to be deduced easily. Instead of considering the complete symmetry point group at the nucleus, it is easier to consider only certain key elements of symmetry; this leads to four simple rules that determine the zero and nonzero components of the complete shielding tensor.},

   abstract = "The first two groups of the Periodic Table have in common that their members exist principally in solution as cations, and their study is thus that of solute-solvent interactions and of ion-ion interactions. The elements Li, Be, and Mg have in addition a covalent chemistry and their covalently bonded compounds are also studied. From the point of view of NMR spectroscopy, all these elements have nuclei with quadrupole moments, though 6Li and 133Cs have two of the smallest moments known. In the case of the group I ions, the ion-solvent interactions are relatively weak, so that we think of the ions as existing in spherical s states with low field gradients. We would thus expect relaxation times to be a maximum in these solutions and modified by the interaction with the solvent. Weak interaction means fast exchange and so only singlets will be observed giving data for the ensemble average of all the possible states experienced by the ions. Where strong interactions occur, these are immediately detected by the metal NMR. In the case of the smaller group II ions, a definite solvation sheath is formed which can be detected by proton NMR for Be or Mg only, though it probably persists for the heavier ions, only being differentiated from the group I ions by the time scale of the solvent exchange.",

	% abstract = {Abstract In this article, the relationships between molecular symmetry, molecular electronic structure, and chemical shielding (CS) tensors are discussed. First, a brief background on the CS interaction and CS tensors is given. Then, the visualization of the three-dimensional nature of CS is described. A simple method for examining the relationship between molecular orbitals (MOs) and CS tensors, using point groups and direct products of irreducible representations of MOs and rotational operators, is outlined. A number of specific examples are discussed, involving CS tensors of different nuclei in molecules of different symmetries, including ethene (D2h), hydrogen fluoride (C∞v), trifluorophosphine (C3v), and water (C2v). Finally, we review the application of this method to CS tensors in several interesting cases previously discussed in the literature, including acetylene (D∞h), the PtX42− series of compounds (D4h) and the decamethylaluminocenium cation (D5d). © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   abstract = "For studying electrode and electrolyte materials for lithium ion batteries, solid-state (SS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of lithium moves into focus of current research. Theoretical simulations of magnetic resonance parameters facilitate the analysis and interpretation of experimental Li SS–NMR spectra and provide unique insight into physical and chemical processes that are determining the spectral profile. In the present paper, the accuracy and reliability of the theoretical simulation methods of Li chemical shielding values is benchmarked by establishing a reference scale for Li SS–NMR of diamagnetic compounds. The impact of geometry, ionic mobility and relativity are discussed. Eventually, the simulation methods are applied to the more complex lithium titanate spinel (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), which is a widely discussed battery anode material. Simulation of the Li SS–NMR spectrum shows that the commonly adopted approach of assigning the resonances to individual crystallographic sites is not unambiguous."
