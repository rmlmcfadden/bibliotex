The effects of differential T2’s arising from exchange broadening on the line shape in powders are described. Methods for the calculation and analysis of T1 anisotropy in partially relaxed spectra of powders for both fast and intermediate exchange regimes are presented.},

   abstract = "The applicability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy continues to expand in physics, chemistry, material science, geology, biology, and medicine. An increasing range of NMR techniques is employed for either spectroscopic studies or imaging purposes, most becoming possible because of the high magnetic fields of superconducting magnets (almost an order of magnitude higher than ordinary iron magnets), and the availability of fast computers for controlling purposes and final data processing. These improvements together with the realization of fast mechanical sample spinning and new pulse techniques have led to high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the perturbing effect of the electric quadrupole interaction becomes less important at higher magnetic fields, the investigation of powder samples with NMR techniques has become more feasible. As a result, the number of publications concerning NMR studies of quadrupole nuclei in powder samples rapidly increased in the eighties. However, since 1987 this number of publications is rather stable and amounts to about 100 per year.",

In a section on the basic spin properties, the fundamental concepts of the nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant, the quadrupolar frequency, and the quadrupolar splitting are defined, while the characteristics of NMR and NQR spectra are introduced and compared. Typical values of quadrupolar coupling constants are tabulated. The following section is concerned with the behavior of quadrupolar spins under RF irradiation. It is followed by a survey of the wide range of experimental NMR methods developed for quadrupolar nuclei. While the descriptions mentioned so far keep quantum mechanical modeling and mathematical expressions to a minimum, the final section introduces the theoretical aspects of quadrupolar spin interactions.}

The critical points of the central-line powder pattern and simulated powder patterns are provided, which allows the determination of quadrupole parameters from experimental spectra.}

	abstract = {Given the typical interaction strength between the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and non-vanishing local, extranuclear field gradients, the electric quadrupole relaxation mechanism is usually dominant for all spin-one or greater nuclei. In general, various quadrupolar relaxation rates can be written in simple, closed form, and features associated with relaxation-induced polarization and coherence transfer are quenched. Such expressions are summarized in the first few sections of this article. Also discussed are consequences associated with the failure of the extreme narrowing approximation that results in multiexponential relaxation. The quadrupolar interaction is traceless and in the motionally narrowed regime, averages to zero. Thus, only line broadening and not line positions are affected. However, the Zeeman and quadrupolar interactions do not commute and second-order (and higher order) corrections may become important. Thus, a discussion of the dynamic frequency shift in quadrupolar spin systems is provided. Finally, it is recognized that efficiently relaxed quadrupolar nuclei influence scalar-coupled spin one-half nuclei. Features associated with this phenomenon are developed in the last section of this article.}
