   abstract = "A random distribution of point defects in cubic solids produces electric field gradients (efg) not present in the ideal crystal. The probabilities for the individual components Vm (m = −2,…. 2) of the efg tensor are not independent of each other, but must be described by a joint probability function g(v−2, v−1, v0, v1, v2). This function is calculated in the limit of small and large defect concentrations, assuming that (i) the defects are uncorrelated and can be represented by unscreened point charges, (ii) an equal number of positively and negatively charged defects exist, and (iii) the continuum approximation holds. As an application, the second-order quadrupolar NMR line broadening from randomly distributed point defects is calculated."
