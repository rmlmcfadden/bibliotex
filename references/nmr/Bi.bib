The quadrupole constant for 75As extrapolated to 0 K was 47.360 MHz, in good agreement with the value deduced from low-temperature specific heat measurements. The quadrupole coupling constant for 209Bi was 51.2 MHz at 195 K, in agreement with the value deduced from the high-field NMR spectrum."

   abstract = "Large negative Knight shift contributions are observed for Sb and Bi in solid Bi. The similar magnitude at both probe atoms rule out p-electron core polarization as a major contribution to the shift. The shift rather seems to scale with the diamagnetic macroscopic susceptibility of bismuth."
