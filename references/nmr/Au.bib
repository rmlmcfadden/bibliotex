   abstract = "By the use of the single-OPW, the expressions for the spin-lattice relaxation time T1(Q) due to the quadrupole interaction and the second moment for the central resonance line are calculated, taking account of the electron interaction. The numerical calculation leads to T1(Q)T = 32 secK which is considerably large in comparison with the value, 13 secK, estimated from the deviation from the Korringa relation. When the single-pseudo-wave function is used, a reasonable value is obtained. The second moment of the central line of 197 Au is calculated by taking account of the effect of strained crystals for the quadrupole moment. It is found that main contributions to the line-width come from the exchange and pseudo-dipole interactions. Some examinations are made for the discrepancy of Stoner's enhancement factor in noble metals between our analysis and the band calculation."
