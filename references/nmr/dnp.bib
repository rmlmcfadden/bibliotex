   abstract = {After a general introduction, two sections are devoted to a survey of the theories of spin temperature and of nuclear relaxation in solids. This is followed by a short section on the so-called well-resolved solid effect, and a much more detailed one on DNP by thermal mixing in the non-linear low spin-temperature domain. One then analyses the various methods of measurement of the nuclear polarisation, as well as an indirect method of detecting the electronic resonance based on the existence of large nuclear polarisations. The final section describes briefly several applications of dynamic nuclear polarisation.}

	abstract = {A method for obtaining strongly polarized nuclear spins in solution has been developed. The method uses low temperature, high magnetic field, and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to strongly polarize nuclear spins in the solid state. The solid sample is subsequently dissolved rapidly in a suitable solvent to create a solution of molecules with hyperpolarized nuclear spins. The polarization is performed in a DNP polarizer, consisting of a super-conducting magnet (3.35 T) and a liquid-helium cooled sample space. The sample is irradiated with microwaves at ≈94 GHz. Subsequent to polarization, the sample is dissolved by an injection system inside the DNP magnet. The dissolution process effectively preserves the nuclear polarization. The resulting hyperpolarized liquid sample can be transferred to a high-resolution NMR spectrometer, where an enhanced NMR signal can be acquired, or it may be used as an agent for in vivo imaging or spectroscopy. In this article we describe the use of the method on aqueous solutions of [13C]urea. Polarizations of 37\% for 13C and 7.8\% for 15N, respectively, were obtained after the dissolution. These polarizations correspond to an enhancement of 44,400 for 13C and 23,500 for 15N, respectively, compared with thermal equilibrium at 9.4 T and room temperature. The method can be used generally for signal enhancement and reduction of measurement time in liquid-state NMR and opens up for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications of DNP-enhanced NMR.},

Such an enhancement method is called dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The article explains his idea, describes the experiments of Carver and Slichter that confirmed his proposal, their demonstration that the method was not limited to metals, describes the nature of immediate impact on the magnetic resonance community, discusses why DNP was not broadly utilized for many years, explains in simple terms how the method works and reports on the new developments in experimental methods that have given DNP an active and exciting future.}

Another described method relies on indirect optical pumping methods at temperatures close to room temperature for the nuclear polarization of rare gases. The various mechanisms of DNP are described in physical terms. This is followed by a succinct description of its main applications in various domains of physics, in chemistry and in medicine."
