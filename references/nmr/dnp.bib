   abstract = {After a general introduction, two sections are devoted to a survey of the theories of spin temperature and of nuclear relaxation in solids. This is followed by a short section on the so-called well-resolved solid effect, and a much more detailed one on DNP by thermal mixing in the non-linear low spin-temperature domain. One then analyses the various methods of measurement of the nuclear polarisation, as well as an indirect method of detecting the electronic resonance based on the existence of large nuclear polarisations. The final section describes briefly several applications of dynamic nuclear polarisation.}

Two other experiments at Illinois inspired by the Overhauser experiments are briefly described: measurement of the spin susceptibility of conduction electrons and measurement of spin–lattice relaxation times in superconductors."

   journal = {Rep. Prog. Physics},
   abstract = {In 1952, Overhauser proposed a method for transferring the large electron spin polarization of conduction electrons in a metal to the metal nuclei, enhancing their polarization one thousand fold. Such an enhancement method is called dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The article explains his idea, describes the experiments of Carver and Slichter that confirmed his proposal, their demonstration that the method was not limited to metals, describes the nature of immediate impact on the magnetic resonance community, discusses why DNP was not broadly utilized for many years, explains in simple terms how the method works and reports on the new developments in experimental methods that have given DNP an active and exciting future.}

   abstract = "Dynamic nuclear polarization, or DNP, refers to the increase of the polarization of nuclear spins in condensed matter, liquid or solid, coupled with electronic spins at low relative concentration, by inducing radio or microwave transitions at frequencies close to the electronic resonance frequency in the external magnetic field. Another described method relies on indirect optical pumping methods at temperatures close to room temperature for the nuclear polarization of rare gases. The various mechanisms of DNP are described in physical terms. This is followed by a succinct description of its main applications in various domains of physics, in chemistry and in medicine."
