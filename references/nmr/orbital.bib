   abstract={In recent years there has been increasing interest in materials with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Nuclear magnetic resonance is a valuable microscopic probe of such systems because of the hyperfine interactions between the nuclear spins and the electron degrees of freedom. In materials with weak SOC the NMR Knight shift contains two contributions: one from the electron orbital susceptibility and the other from the electron spin susceptibility. These contributions can be separated by plotting the Knight shift versus the bulk susceptibility and extracting the slope and intercept. Here we examine the case where the SOC is non-negligible, in which case the slope and intercept are no longer simply related to these two contributions. These results have important implications for NMR studies of heavy fermions, as well as 4d and 5d systems.}

   abstract = "We study the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate and Knight shift in the presence of the orbital and quadrupole interactions for three-dimensional Dirac electron systems (e.g., bismuth–antimony alloys). By using recent results of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility and permittivity, we obtain rigorous results of the relaxation rates (1/T1)orb and (1/T1)Q, which are due to the orbital and quadrupole interactions, respectively, and show that (1/T1)Q gives a negligible contribution compared with (1/T1)orb. It is found that (1/T1)orb exhibits anomalous dependences on temperature T and chemical potential μ. When μ is inside the band gap, (1/T1)orb∼T3log(2T/ω0) for temperatures above the band gap, where ω0 is the nuclear Larmor frequency. When μ lies in the conduction or valence bands, (1/T1)orb∝TkF2log(2vFkF/ω0) for low temperatures, where kF and vF are the Fermi momentum and Fermi velocity, respectively. The Knight shift Korb due to the orbital interaction also shows anomalous dependences on T and μ. It is shown that Korb is negative and its magnitude significantly increases with decreasing temperature when μ is located in the band gap. Because the anomalous dependences in Korb is caused by the interband particle-hole excitations across the small band gap while (1/T1)orb is governed by the intraband excitations, the Korringa relation does not hold in the Dirac electron systems."
