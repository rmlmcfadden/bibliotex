	% abstract = {By collinearly laser optical pumping of atoms and ions, the laser nuclear-spin-polarization beam facility at TRIUMF-ISAC has successfully provided highly nuclear-spin polarized radioactive isotope beams, such as 8Li and 31Mg, to study material science, biochemistry, nuclear physics, and fundamental symmetries for over 20 years. In recent years with emerging research in all these fields using β-decay asymmetry of polarized nuclei, more novel/exotic species need to be laser-polarized, such as 230,232Ac and 58,74Cu. To develop optical pumping schemes and provide novel nuclear-spin polarized beams to meet these increasing demands the classical ISAC polarizer facility requires upgrades. In this paper, an overview of the polarizer facility is presented and recent, as well as ongoing, upgrades and development work are discussed.}
