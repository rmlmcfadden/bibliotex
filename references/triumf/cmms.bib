   abstract = "The TRIUMF low energy muon channel, M20, was completely rebuilt in 1983. Amongst the features incorporated into the new channel is a 3 m long Wien filter or dc separator. For surface and sub-surface μ+ beams, the magnetic field of this device is sufficient to rotate the muon spin from its natural orientation, antiparallel to the beam momentum, by 90° into a transverse orientation. The performance of this muon “spin rotator” is described."
