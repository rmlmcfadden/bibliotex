   abstract = "The production of radioactive ion beams (RIB) from spallation targets by irradiation with a continuous 500MeV proton beam, has been routine at TRIUMF for several years. Based on the experience with composite refractory carbide targets a procedure for the fabrication of UC2/C targets was developed. It includes the preparation of UC2 by carbothermal reduction of UO2, the slip-casting of fine-grained UC2/C slurry on graphite foil under inert gas atmosphere and the cutting of composite target discs which are stacked up to a lamellar structure. The thermal properties of such an arrangement are adequate to withstand the high power deposition of an intense, continuous proton beam and also beneficial for the fast release of short-lived radioactive isotopes. Molecular structure, particle size and the impact of sintering of the target discs were investigated via XRD and SEM. Thickness and mass distribution were measured with position-sensitive LIII-edge densitometry. The results confirm that the properties of the UC2/C target material are well suited for RIB production at TRIUMF while there is still room for improvement with regard to uniformity of mass distribution in target disc thickness."

   abstract = "The demand for intensity, purity, reliability and availability of short-lived isotopes far from stability is steadily high, and considerably exceeding the supply. In many cases the ISOL (Isotope Separation On-Line) method can provide beams of high intensity and purity. Limitations in terms of accessible chemical species and minimum half-life are driven mainly by chemical reactions and physical processes inside of the thick target. A wide range of materials are in use, ranging from thin metallic foils and liquids to refractory ceramics, while poly-phasic mixed uranium carbides have become the reference target material for most ISOL facilities world-wide. Target material research and development is often complex and especially important post-irradiation analyses are hindered by the high intrinsic radiotoxicity of these materials. However, recent achievements have proven that these investigations are possible if the effort of different facilities is combined, leading to the development of new material matrices that can supply new beams of unprecedented intensity and beam current stability."

As part of the ARIEL target material research and development campaign, a new method to produce targets of mixed uranium carbide with excess graphite has been proposed and tested. The resulting material is comparable in composition with the conventional target material and is produced ten times faster. The reduction in production time will liberate the resources and equipment for research and development leading to new target materials with improved radioisotope release properties for ARIEL."

   abstract = "Two AC magnets were installed to scan the 500 MeV proton beam in a circular pattern on the TRIUMF ISAC target. Rotating the proton beam produces a more uniform average power deposition, which increases the maximum amount of total beam power that targets can tolerate. The magnet system consists of a pair of two ferrite AC magnets that rotate the proton beam at a frequency of up to 400 Hz. A new tune was developed to produce a controllable spot size, while having an approximate parallel beam on target and a 90° phase advance between the raster magnets and the target. A set of diagnostics was developed to monitor the rotating beam. Online tests have shown that we can increase the radioactive ion beams (RIB) yields from a target while maintaining same maximum temperature."

In particular, the ISAC (Isotope Separation and ACceleration) facility provides the infrastructure to deliver customized rare ion beams for fundamental research in nuclear physics, astrophysics, material science, and nuclear medicine. A continuous effort is made to develop new radioactive ion beams (RIB) and improve their intensity or purity, properties that depend strongly on the type of target, operating conditions, the ion source, and beam transport efficiency. Yield data and theoretical production rates based on FLUKA and Geant4 simulations are collected in the TRIUMF Isotope Database, providing a valuable resource for RIB development and experiment planning. This paper introduces the newly upgraded TRIUMF Isotope Database and presents examples on how its resources can be used to plan experiments and understand the origin of certain RIB. In particular we discuss the collection of 155Tb which is an important component of medical isotope research at TRIUMF.}
