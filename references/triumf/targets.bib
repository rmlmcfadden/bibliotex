   abstract = "The production of radioactive ion beams (RIB) from spallation targets by irradiation with a continuous 500MeV proton beam, has been routine at TRIUMF for several years. Based on the experience with composite refractory carbide targets a procedure for the fabrication of UC2/C targets was developed. It includes the preparation of UC2 by carbothermal reduction of UO2, the slip-casting of fine-grained UC2/C slurry on graphite foil under inert gas atmosphere and the cutting of composite target discs which are stacked up to a lamellar structure. The thermal properties of such an arrangement are adequate to withstand the high power deposition of an intense, continuous proton beam and also beneficial for the fast release of short-lived radioactive isotopes. Molecular structure, particle size and the impact of sintering of the target discs were investigated via XRD and SEM. Thickness and mass distribution were measured with position-sensitive LIII-edge densitometry. The results confirm that the properties of the UC2/C target material are well suited for RIB production at TRIUMF while there is still room for improvement with regard to uniformity of mass distribution in target disc thickness."

   abstract = "The demand for intensity, purity, reliability and availability of short-lived isotopes far from stability is steadily high, and considerably exceeding the supply. In many cases the ISOL (Isotope Separation On-Line) method can provide beams of high intensity and purity. Limitations in terms of accessible chemical species and minimum half-life are driven mainly by chemical reactions and physical processes inside of the thick target. A wide range of materials are in use, ranging from thin metallic foils and liquids to refractory ceramics, while poly-phasic mixed uranium carbides have become the reference target material for most ISOL facilities world-wide. Target material research and development is often complex and especially important post-irradiation analyses are hindered by the high intrinsic radiotoxicity of these materials. However, recent achievements have proven that these investigations are possible if the effort of different facilities is combined, leading to the development of new material matrices that can supply new beams of unprecedented intensity and beam current stability."
