   abstract = {Much of small polaron theory is based on highly idealized models, often essentially a continuum description with a single vibrational frequency. These models ignore much of the wealth of experimental data, which find interpretation in many atomistic simulations. The authors review here a range of properties of small polarons in real, rather than model, systems. The phenomena fall into three main classes: (i) the mechanisms and dynamics of self-trapping of polarons; (ii) static properties-the relative energies of large and small polarons, the optical transitions expected, their effect on positions of other ions and on lattice vibrations, their population in thermal equilibrium, and so on; (iii) small polaron hopping and diffusion. The authors discuss the key concepts and methods of calculation of polarons, and explore the properties of self-trapped-holes and excitons in ionic crystals, and those of an excess electron in liquid water.}

   abstract = "The formation of polarons is a pervasive phenomenon in transition metal oxide compounds, with a strong impact on the physical properties and functionalities of the hosting materials. In its original formulation, the polaron problem considers a single charge carrier in a polar crystal interacting with its surrounding lattice. Depending on the spatial extension of the polaron quasiparticle, originating from the coupling between the excess charge and the phonon field, one speaks of small or large polarons. This chapter discusses the modeling of small polarons in real materials, with a particular focus on the archetypal polaron material TiO2. After an introductory part, surveying the fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of the physics of polarons, the chapter examines how to model small polarons using first-principles schemes in order to predict, understand, and interpret a variety of polaron properties in bulk phases and surfaces. Following the spirit of this handbook, different types of computational procedures and prescriptions are presented with specific instructions on the setup required to model polaron effects.",
