	% abstract = { Defect and solute diffusion coefficients, namely DI and D B∗, are calculated for a b.c.c. lattice when diffusion occurs by a dumbbell mechanism. Two possible symmetries of the defect are envisaged, together with all the jump frequencies invoked so far to interpret the experimental data. For simplicity and tractability, only the binding energy of the mixed dumbbell is taken into account; all the interaction energies of a solute-defect complex when separated by a first-neighbour distance or more are ignored. The full correlation effect of the infinite lattice is taken into account using a double Fourier-Laplace transform. Unlike the vacancy case, the defect concentration CI does not enter DB∗ in a simple multiplicative way; the self-diffusion coefficient D A∗ is not equal to f 0 C I D I, where f0 is the correlation factor for self-diffusion, because the average jump length of an atom is not equal to the jump length of the defect; finally, the isotope effect is a complicated function of the jump frequencies and cannot be restated in the simple form f 0 ΔK.}

	% abstract = {We have constructed a set of embedded atom method (EAM) potentials for Fe, Ta, W and V and used them in order to study point defect properties. The parametrizations of the potentials ensure that the third order elastic constants are continuous and they have been fitted to the cohesive energies, the lattice constants, the unrelaxed vacancy formation energies and the second order elastic constants. Formation energies for different self-interstitials reveal that the 〈110〉 split dumbbell is the most stable configuration for Fe while for Ta, W and V we find that the 〈111〉 split dumbbell is preferred. Self-interstitial migration energies are simulated using the nudged elastic band method and for Fe and W the migration energies are found to be in good agreement with experimental and ab initio data. Migration energies for Ta and V self-interstitials are found to be quite low. The calculated formation, activation and migration energies for monovacancies are in good agreement with experimental data. Formation energies for divacancies reveal that the second nearest neighbor divacancy is more energetically favorable than nearest neighbor divacancies and the migration energies indicate that nearest neighbor migration paths are more likely to occur than second nearest neighbor migration jumps. For Fe, we have also studied the influence of the pair potential behavior between the second and third nearest neighbor on the stability of the 〈110〉 split dumbbell, which revealed that the higher the energy level of the pair potential is in that region, the more stable the 〈110〉 split dumbbell becomes.}
