   abstract = {Abstract It is proposed that the melting process is governed by the creation of lattice defects followed by a relaxation of the lattice in the vicinity of the defects. At the melting point Tm the mole fraction xL of defects within the melt is given by xL = L/ho (L heat of fusion; ho formation enthalpy of defects within the solid).},

   abstract = {Abstract The mole fraction of vacancies within melts at their melting points is found to be xL = = 0.125 in the case of elements (with exception of inert gases), alkali halides, binary oxides and organic compounds. As to inert gases it is xL = 0.194. The formation enthalpy of vacancies (Schottky defects) is given by hS = L/xL (L heat of fusion) in every case. The increase of volume due to melting can be explained well by the vacancy model of melting: Î”V = VSxL (VS formation volume of Schottky defects).},

   abstract = {Abstract The formation entropy of Schottky defects (vacancies) is calculated from the entropy of fusion and the concentration xL = 0.125 of vacancies within the melt at melting point Tm. The formation of vacancies is connected with a decrease of the vibrational frequency of those lattice forming particles (atoms, ions, molecules) being neighbours of the vacancies. Theoretical values of the vacancy concentrations xs agree with those xs obtained with the help of experimentally determined free formation enthalpies of the defects.},
