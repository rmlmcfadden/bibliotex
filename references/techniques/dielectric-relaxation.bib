Certain unique features of the universal behaviour strongly suggest the dominant role of many-body interactions.",

   abstract = {This review presents a wide-ranging broad-brush picture of dielectric relaxation in solids, making use of the existence of a `universality' of dielectric response regardless of a wide diversity of materials and structures, with dipolar as well as charge-carrier polarization. The review of the experimental evidence includes extreme examples of highly conducting materials showing strongly dispersive behaviour, low-loss materials with a `flat', frequency-independent susceptibility, dipolar loss peaks etc. The surprising conclusion is that despite the evident complexity of the relaxation processes certain very simple relations prevail and this leads to a better insight into the nature of these processes.}
