	abstract = {Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a process for growing thin, epitaxial films of a wide variety of materials, ranging from oxides to semiconductors to metals. It was first applied to the growth of compound semiconductors. That is still the most common usage, in large part because of the high technological value of such materials to the electronics industry. In this process beams of atoms or molecules in an ultra-high vacuum environment are incident upon a heated crystal that has previously been processed to produce a nearly atomically clean surface. The arriving constituent atoms form a crystalline layer in registry with the substrate, i.e., an epitaxial film. These films are remarkable because the composition can be rapidly changed, producing crystalline interfaces that are almost atomically abrupt. Thus, it has been possible to produce a large range of unique structures, including quantum well devices, superlattices, lasers, etc., all of which benefit from the precise control of composition during growth. Because of the cleanliness of the growth environment and because of the precise control over composition, MBE structures closely approximate the idealized models used in solid state theory. This discussion is intended as an introduction to the concept and the experimental procedures used in MBE growth. The refinement of experimental procedures has been the key to the successful fabrication of electronically significant devices, which in turn has generated the widespread interest in the MBE as a research tool. MBE experiments have provided a wealth of new information bearing on the general mechanisms involved in epitaxial growth, since many of the phenomena initially observed during MBE have since been repeated using other crystal growth processes. We also summarize the general types of layered structures that have contributed to the rapid expansion of interest in MBE and its various offshoots. Finally we consider some of the problems that remain in the growth of heteroepitaxial structures, specifically, the problem of mismatch in lattice constant between layers and between layer and substrate. The discussion is phenomenological, not theoretical; MBE has been primarily an experimental approach based on simple concepts.}
