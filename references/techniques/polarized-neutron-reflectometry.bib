	abstract = {A description is given of the prototype polarized neutron reflectometer installed at the intense pulsed neutron source. This instrument is designed for determining the magnetic depth profiles near the surfaces of ferromagnets and superconductors, by measuring the spin‐dependent reflectivities of a well‐collimated (0.01°) beam of cold neutrons from surfaces of a few cm2. Magnetic profiles can be determined with the spatial resolution of 40 Å, over thicknesses up to 5000 Å. Variations of the magnetic flux of the order of 10−5 G cm2 can be detected.},

	abstract = {A review is given of the role of polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) in measuring the magnetic profile close to the surface and in thin films of superconductors and magnetic materials. For type I and type II superconductors PNR provided a new and direct determination of the penetration depth. For very thin ferromagnetic films PNR was able to determine the absolute value of the magnetic moments. In magnetic superlattices, formed by the alternation of ferromagnetic layers and nonmagnetic spacers, PNR was used to confirm the basic magnetic structure as well as to determine the direction of the magnetic moments of the individual layers. In addition to reflectivity, forward magnetic scattering may very well extend the usefulness of PNR to the case of laterally dishomogeneous systems.}
