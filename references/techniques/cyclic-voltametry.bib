    abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of cyclic voltammetry, many students do not receive formalized training in this technique as part of their coursework. Confronted with self-instruction, students can be left wondering where to start. Here, a short introduction to cyclic voltammetry is provided to help the reader with data acquisition and interpretation. Tips and common pitfalls are provided, and the reader is encouraged to apply what is learned in short, simple training modules provided in the Supporting Information. Armed with the basics, the motivated aspiring electrochemist will find existing resources more accessible and will progress much faster in the understanding of cyclic voltammetry.}
