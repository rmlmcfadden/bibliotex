	abstract = {SIMNRA is a Microsoft Windows 95/Windows NT program with fully graphical user interface for the simulation of non-Rutherford backscattering, nuclear reaction analysis and elastic recoil detection analysis with MeV ions. About 300 different non-Rutherford and nuclear reactions cross-sections are included. SIMNRA can calculate any ion-target combination including incident heavy ions and any geometry including transmission geometry. Arbitrary multi-layered foils in front of the detector can be used. Energy loss straggling includes the corrections by Chu to Bohrâ€™s straggling theory, propagation of straggling in thick layers, geometrical straggling and straggling due to multiple small angle scattering. The effects of plural large angle scattering can be calculated approximately. Typical computing times are in the range of several seconds.},
