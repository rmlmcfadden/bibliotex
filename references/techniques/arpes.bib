   abstract = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of solids. By measuring the kinetic energy and angular distribution of the electrons photoemitted from a sample illuminated with sufficiently high-energy radiation, one can gain information on both the energy and momentum of the electrons propagating inside a material. This is of vital importance in elucidating the connection between electronic, magnetic, and chemical structure of solids, in particular for those complex systems which cannot be appropriately described within the independent-particle picture. The last decade witnessed significant progress in this technique and its applications, thus ushering in a new era in photoelectron spectroscopy; today, ARPES experiments with 2 meV energy resolution and 0.2Â° angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. In this paper we will review the fundamentals of the technique and present some illustrative experimental results; we will show how ARPES can probe the momentum-dependent electronic structure of solids providing detailed information on band dispersion and Fermi surface as well as on the strength and nature of many-body correlations, which may profoundly affect the one-electron excitation spectrum and in turn the macroscopic physical properties.}

   abstract = "Electronic structures are critical characteristics that determine the electrical, magnetic and optical properties of materials. With the capability of directly visualizing band dispersions and Fermi surfaces, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has emerged as a powerful experimental tool to extract the electronic structures of materials and the coupling of these electronic structures to different degrees of freedom in crystal lattices. In the past three decades, advances in instrumentation and light sources have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ARPES experiments. These advances have enabled the application of ARPES in novel material systems to aid our understanding of their physical properties and behaviours. In this Review, we give a brief introduction to the principles of ARPES and outline its applications in different material systems, with a focus on topological quantum materials and transition metal dichalcogenides.",
