    abstract = {This second edition of this book fully embraces the advances represented by the scanning tunnelling microscope and, especially, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. The book includes images of single atoms and spectral images of impurity states in high temperature superconductors. The background and current status are provided for the applications of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, to single atoms and molecules, including the determination of bonding energies and vibrational frequencies. The adaptation of the McMillanâ€“Rowell analysis, based on the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity, to include proximity electron tunnelling spectroscopy PETS, is described. The applications to high temperature superconductivity HTC of cuprate and iron-based materials are carefully introduced and the current status is described. A new section covers the astounding advances in instrumentation, which now routinely provide atomic resolution, and, in addition, developments in imaging and image processing, such as Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy.},
