	abstract = {There are a large number of surface analytical methods, each with their own strengths and limitations. This review provides tools and an amalgamated source of information to those new to surface characterization or to those who would like to select the most appropriate, commonly accessible, surface characterization technique for their sample. It includes a quick technique selection guide for narrowing down suitable methods for obtaining a range of compositional, structural, and surface properties. Considerations and recommendations for approaching instrument technicians and field experts are also discussed. To further aid in technique selection, comparative tables for complementary techniques are included in addition to case studies in technique selection and application, and finally, a brief overview of commonly employed analysis methods is provided, including related important considerations.},
