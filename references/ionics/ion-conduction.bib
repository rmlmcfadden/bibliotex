   abstract = {Solid State Ionics has its roots essentially in Europe. First foundations were laid by Michael Faraday who discovered the solid electrolytes Ag2S and PbF2 and coined terms such as cation and anion, electrode and electrolyte. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the main lines of development toward Solid State Ionics, pursued in Europe, concerned the linear laws of transport, structural analysis, disorder and entropy and the electrochemical storage and conversion of energy. Fundamental contributions were then made by Walther Nernst, who derived the Nernst equation and detected ionic conduction in heterovalently doped zirconia, which he utilized in his Nernst lamp. Another big step forward was the discovery of the extraordinary properties of alpha silver iodide in 1914. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the concept of point defects was established by Yakov Il'ich Frenkel, Walter Schottky and Carl Wagner, including the development of point-defect thermodynamics by Schottky and Wagner. In terms of point defects, ionic (and electronic) transport in ionic crystals became easy to visualize. In an ‘evolving scheme of materials science’, point disorder precedes structural disorder, as displayed by the AgI-type solid electrolytes (and other ionic crystals), by ion-conducting glasses, polymer electrolytes and nano-composites. During the last few decades, much progress has been made in finding and investigating novel solid electrolytes and in using them for the preservation of our environment, in particular in advanced solid state battery systems, fuel cells and sensors. Since 1972, international conferences have been held in the field of Solid State Ionics, and the International Society for Solid State Ionics was founded at one of them, held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in 1987.}

   abstract = {The requirements for rechargeable batteries place high demands on the electrodes. Efficient storage means accommodating both ions and electrons, not only in substantial amounts, but also with substantial velocities. The materials’ space could be largely extended by decoupling the roles of ions and electrons such that transport and accommodation of ions take place in one phase of a composite, and transport and accommodation of electrons in the other phase. Here we discuss this synergistic concept being equally applicable for positive and negative electrodes along with examples from the literature for Li-based and Ag-based cells. Not only does the concept have the potential to mitigate the trade-off between power density and energy density, it also enables a generalized view of bulk and interfacial storage as necessary for nanocrystals. It furthermore allows for testable predictions of heterogeneous storage in passivation layers, dependence of transfer resistance on the state of charge, or heterogeneous storage of hydrogen at appropriate contacts. We also present an outlook on constructing artificial mixed-conductor electrodes that have the potential to achieve both high energy density and high power density.},

   abstract = {Abstract Rechargeable battery cells are composed of two electrodes separated by an ion-conducting electrolyte. While the energy density of the cell is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and amount of charge they can store, the processes at the electrode–electrolyte interface govern the battery's lifetime and performance. Viable battery cells rely on unimpeded ion transport across this interface, which depends on its composition and structure. These properties are challenging to determine as interfacial phases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous, and can be very reactive. The recent developments and applications of solid state NMR spectroscopy in the study of interfacial phenomena in rechargeable batteries based on lithium and sodium chemistries are reviewed. The different NMR interactions are surveyed and how these are used to shed light on the chemical composition and architecture of interfacial phases as well as directly probe ion transport across them is described. By combining new methods in solid state NMR spectroscopy with other analytical tools, a holistic description of the electrode–electrolyte interface can be obtained. This will enable the design of improved interfaces for developing battery cells with high energy, high power, and longer lifetime.},
