In this work, β-NMR is applied, for the first time, to record an NMR spectrum for a species in solution. 31Mg β-NMR spectra are measured for as few as 107 magnesium ions in ionic liquid (EMIM-Ac) within minutes, as a prototypical test case. Resonances are observed at 3882.9 and 3887.2 kHz in an external field of 0.3 T. The key achievement of the current work is to demonstrate that β-NMR is applicable for the analysis of species in solution, and thus represents a novel spectroscopic technique for use in general chemistry and potentially in biochemistry.},

   abstract = {Applications of nuclear spectroscopic techniques are well established in chemistry and biochemistry, where, for example, conventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an indispensable analytical tool [1]. NMR is used routinely to identify small organic molecules in quality control, and in more complex research applications to elucidate structure and dynamics of large biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Additionally, magnetic resonance (MR) scanners are available at most large hospitals for imaging, and it is now even possible to acquire affordable desk top NMR instruments with permanent magnets, aimed at small businesses and educational institutions. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy faces certain limitations, mainly due to: (1) relatively poor sensitivity and (2) the fact that there are elements that are difficult to detect, because of poor NMR response. To overcome the first problem, a variety of hyperpolarization techniques have been developed, reaching nuclear spin polarization in the \% range [2], which is far beyond what may be achieved at thermal equilibrium even in strong external magnetic fields at room temperature. β-detected NMR (β-NMR) spectroscopy belongs to this family of specialized NMR techniques, where considerable nuclear spin polarization is created prior to the NMR measurement. The sensitivity of β-NMR spectroscopy is further enhanced, as it is a radioisotope-based technique, exploiting the detection of anisotropic emission of β-particles from the spin polarized nuclei, vide infra, leading to a billion-fold or higher increase in sensitivity as compared to conventional NMR spectroscopy on stable isotopes. In addition to this, some of the elements which are problematic in conventional NMR spectroscopy, such as Mg, Ca, Cu, and Zn, already are or might be accessible with β-NMR spectroscopy [3–5]. Several applications of β-NMR spectroscopy in nuclear, solid state physics, and materials science have been published over the past decades [3–14] and references therein, and with the project described herein, we aim to advance the applications to solution chemistry and biochemistry [5].}

VITO is a dedicated beam line for producing laser-induced spin-polarized beams of both, atoms and ions, and it has been commissioned in response to the continuously growing demand for the use of spin-polarized beams. The new VITO beam line is a modification of the formerly existing ultra-high vacuum beam line, connecting ASPIC (Apparatus for Surface Physics and Interfaces at CERN), and it has been under construction since the beginning of 2014. Once fully commissioned, VITO will open up numerous possibilities for carrying out multidisciplinary experiments in the areas of nuclear and solid state physics, fundamental interaction physics and biophysics. In its final stage the VITO beam line will provide three fully independent experimental stations: UHV chamber for material science applications, a β-asymmetry station where highly-polarized ions will be available, and a central open-end station suitable for travelling experiments. The VITO beam line will operate in two different modes providing either beams of spin-polarized atoms or ions, or non-polarized ion beams to all three end stations operating from 10−10mbar to 50mbar. Recent experimental campaigns with stable and radioactive beams have allowed for testing VITO’s constituent parts and have demonstrated 96\% of ion beam transmission to the collection chamber installed on the central station. The first experimental results obtained with on-line Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) spectroscopy using 68mCu ion-beams will be briefly discussed."

ISOLDE is the world flagship for the on-line production of exotic radioactive isotopes, with high yields, high elemental selectivity and isotopic purity. Consequently, it hosts a panoply of state-of-the-art nuclear techniques which apply nuclear methods to research on life sciences, material science and bio-chemical physics. The ease of detecting radioactivity—<1 ppm concentrations—is one of the features which distinguishes the use of radioisotopes for materials science research. The manner in which nuclear momenta of excited nuclear states interact with their local electronic and magnetic environment, or how charged emitted particles interact with the crystalline lattices allow the determination of the location, its action and the role of the selected impurity element at the nanoscopic state. ISOLDE offers an unrivalled range of available radioactive elements and this is attracting an increasing user community in the field of nuclear SSP research and brings together a community of materials scientists and specialists in nuclear solid state techniques. This article describes the current status of this programme along with recent illustrative results, predicting a bright future for these unique research methods and collaborations.}

Intensive design work, which took place in 2016, allowed the installation of the first stage of the polarization line. With this experimental setup, the ion beam can be neutralized, polarized and implanted into a solid sample inside an electromagnet which also hosts β-detectors, where the degree of nuclear spin polarization can be measured. In autumn 2016 the setup was commissioned using short-lived 26Na and 28Na beams which were polarized in the D2 line from their atomic ground state. The previously observed degrees of β asymmetry were reproduced and thus the beamline is now ready for the first physics experiments with spin-polarized radioactive beams.}

Despite the long history of the ISOL technique which exploits thick targets, boron beams have up to now not been available. This is due to the low volatility of elemental boron and its high chemical reactivity which make the definition of an appropriate production target unit difficult. In addition, the short half-lives of all boron radioisotopes complicate tracer release studies. We report here on dedicated offline release studies by neutron capture and alpha detection done with implanted 10B in prospective target materials, as well as molecule formation and ionization tests, which suggested the use of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) as target material and injection of sulfur hexafluoride SF6 to promote volatile boron fluoride formation. Two target units equipped with an arc discharge electron impact ion source VADIS coupled to a water cooled transfer line to retain non-volatile elements and molecules were subsequently tested online. The measured yield of these first 8B ISOL beams increases in the series ${}^{8}\mathrm{BF}_{3} < {}^{8}\mathrm{BF} < {}^{8}\mathrm{B} < {}^{8}\mathrm{BF}_{2}$8 BF 3<8 BF <8B<8 BF 2, reaching a maximum yield of $ 6.4 \times 10^{4}$6.4×1048BF2+ ions per μC of protons.",

Presented in this work are two different complementary laser interaction studies. The first is a combined laser spectroscopy and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay study of odd-odd isotopes 180,182Au, while the second highlights the recent developments at ISOLDE?s new laser polarisation beamline, culminating in the most precise deduction of the magnetic moments of 26?31Na to date. The investigation of laser-ionized odd-odd isotopes 180,182Au was performed using the Resonant Ionisation Laser Ion Source, Windmill and ISOLTRAP Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer. A complex fine structure {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay pattern of 180Au was deduced providing an insight into the low-lying levels in the daughter nucleus 176Ir. The {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay branching ratio of b{\ensuremath{\alpha}}(180Au) = 0.58(10) \% has also been derived, permitting calculation of the reduced {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay widths and determining the degree of hindrance of respective {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay branches. From complementary measurements of the hyperfine structure, magnetic moments of {\ensuremath{\mu}}I(180Au) = 0.83(7) {\ensuremath{\mu}}N and {\ensuremath{\mu}}I(182Au) = +1.68(5) {\ensuremath{\mu}}N were deduced. Based on the observed hyperfine structure pattern, a preferred ground state spin I(180Aug) = (1+) is proposed, and the assignment of I(182Aug) = 2+ in this work, is consistent with previous studies. The magnetic moment of 26Na, has been determined for the first time with parts-per-million precision, which is a hundred-fold improvement over the usual precision achievable for such short-lived nuclei. This achievement was possible by applying the ultrasensitive {\ensuremath{\beta}}-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technique to a liquid-state sample at the laser polarization beamline. This result, combined with data from the literature, has further improved the uncertainty of the magnetic moments of 27?31Na to the dozen ppm level. Extending this approach to other isotopic chains would enlarge the palette of {\ensuremath{\beta}}-NMR nuclei to a variety of new isotopes across the nuclear chart.}

We demonstrate the potential of this combined approach with the 1.1 s half-life radioactive nucleus 26Na, which is relevant for biochemical studies.
