   abstract = {Radioactive atoms have been used in solid state physics for many years. Established nuclear techniques such as Mößbauer spectroscopy, perturbed angular correlation, -NMR and emission channelling have now been joined by new and successful tracer techniques like radioactive deep level transient spectroscopy, capacitance voltage measurements, Hall-effect measurements or photoluminescence spectroscopy. Numerous radioactive species, ranging from  to , are employed to attack problems involved with defects or impurities in metals, semiconductors and superconductors. This paper aims to give an idea of the potential of modern `radioactive solid state physics' by briefly explaining the techniques used and describing some typical experiments.}

   abstract = {Abstract β-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is highly sensitive compared to conventional NMR spectroscopy, and may be applied for several elements across the periodic table. β-NMR has previously been successfully applied in the fields of nuclear and solid-state physics. In this work, β-NMR is applied, for the first time, to record an NMR spectrum for a species in solution. 31Mg β-NMR spectra are measured for as few as 107 magnesium ions in ionic liquid (EMIM-Ac) within minutes, as a prototypical test case. Resonances are observed at 3882.9 and 3887.2 kHz in an external field of 0.3 T. The key achievement of the current work is to demonstrate that β-NMR is applicable for the analysis of species in solution, and thus represents a novel spectroscopic technique for use in general chemistry and potentially in biochemistry.},

  abstract = {Solid state physics (SSP) research at ISOLDE has been running since the mid-1970s and accounts for about 10\%–15\% of the overall physics programme. ISOLDE is the world flagship for the on-line production of exotic radioactive isotopes, with high yields, high elemental selectivity and isotopic purity. Consequently, it hosts a panoply of state-of-the-art nuclear techniques which apply nuclear methods to research on life sciences, material science and bio-chemical physics. The ease of detecting radioactivity—<1 ppm concentrations—is one of the features which distinguishes the use of radioisotopes for materials science research. The manner in which nuclear momenta of excited nuclear states interact with their local electronic and magnetic environment, or how charged emitted particles interact with the crystalline lattices allow the determination of the location, its action and the role of the selected impurity element at the nanoscopic state. ISOLDE offers an unrivalled range of available radioactive elements and this is attracting an increasing user community in the field of nuclear SSP research and brings together a community of materials scientists and specialists in nuclear solid state techniques. This article describes the current status of this programme along with recent illustrative results, predicting a bright future for these unique research methods and collaborations.}

We present here different simulations leading to the design and construction of it, as well as technical details of the full setup and examples of the achieved polarizations for several radioisotopes. Beamline simulations show a good transmission through the entire line, in agreement with observations. Simulations of the induced nuclear spin-polarization as a function of atom–laser interaction length are presented for 26,28Na, and for 35Ar, which is studied in this work. Adiabatic spin rotation calculations of the spin-polarized ensemble of atoms, and how this influences the observed nuclear ensemble polarization, are also performed for the same nuclei. For 35Ar, we show that multiple-frequency pumping enhances the ensemble polarization by a factor 1.85, in agreement with predictions from a rate equations model."

   abstract = {Lasers are a powerful spectroscopic tool that have been exploited for decades to elucidate information about nuclear structure. Presented in this work are two different complementary laser interaction studies. The first is a combined laser spectroscopy and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay study of odd-odd isotopes 180,182Au, while the second highlights the recent developments at ISOLDE?s new laser polarisation beamline, culminating in the most precise deduction of the magnetic moments of 26?31Na to date. The investigation of laser-ionized odd-odd isotopes 180,182Au was performed using the Resonant Ionisation Laser Ion Source, Windmill and ISOLTRAP Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer. A complex fine structure {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay pattern of 180Au was deduced providing an insight into the low-lying levels in the daughter nucleus 176Ir. The {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay branching ratio of b{\ensuremath{\alpha}}(180Au) = 0.58(10) \% has also been derived, permitting calculation of the reduced {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay widths and determining the degree of hindrance of respective {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-decay branches. From complementary measurements of the hyperfine structure, magnetic moments of {\ensuremath{\mu}}I(180Au) = 0.83(7) {\ensuremath{\mu}}N and {\ensuremath{\mu}}I(182Au) = +1.68(5) {\ensuremath{\mu}}N were deduced. Based on the observed hyperfine structure pattern, a preferred ground state spin I(180Aug) = (1+) is proposed, and the assignment of I(182Aug) = 2+ in this work, is consistent with previous studies. The magnetic moment of 26Na, has been determined for the first time with parts-per-million precision, which is a hundred-fold improvement over the usual precision achievable for such short-lived nuclei. This achievement was possible by applying the ultrasensitive {\ensuremath{\beta}}-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technique to a liquid-state sample at the laser polarization beamline. This result, combined with data from the literature, has further improved the uncertainty of the magnetic moments of 27?31Na to the dozen ppm level. Extending this approach to other isotopic chains would enlarge the palette of {\ensuremath{\beta}}-NMR nuclei to a variety of new isotopes across the nuclear chart.}

   abstract = "We determine for the first time the magnetic dipole moment of a short-lived nucleus with part-per-million (ppm) accuracy. To achieve this two orders of magnitude improvement over previous studies, we implement a number of innovations into our β-detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (β-NMR) setup at ISOLDE/CERN. Using liquid samples as hosts we obtain narrow, sub-kHz linewidth, resonances, while a simultaneous in-situ 1H NMR measurement allows us to calibrate and stabilize the magnetic field to ppm precision, thus eliminating the need for additional β-NMR reference measurements. Furthermore, we use ab initio calculations of NMR shielding constants to improve the accuracy of the reference magnetic moment, thus removing a large systematic error. We demonstrate the potential of this combined approach with the 1.1 s half-life radioactive nucleus 26Na, which is relevant for biochemical studies. Our technique can be readily extended to other isotopic chains, providing accurate magnetic moments for many short-lived nuclei. Furthermore, we discuss how our approach can open the path towards a wide range of applications of the ultra-sensitive β-NMR in physics, chemistry, and biology.",
