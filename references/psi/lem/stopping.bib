	% abstract = {The range of low-energy μ+ in a thin Al film deposited on a quartz glass substrate has been investigated as a function of the μ+ implantation energy by measuring the amplitude of the diamagnetic signal in a transverse field experiment. The μ+ implantation energy was varied between 3.4 and 29.4keV. The μ+ asymmetry, which reflects the fraction of μ+ stopped in Al, is found to decrease with increasing energy. The results are compared and found in good agreement with predictions of a Monte Carlo program, which simulates the implantation profiles of muons in matter.}

	abstract = "The implantation of low energy polarized positive muons (μ+) with energies between 0.5 and 30 keV in thin (<100 nm) Al, Cu, Ag, and Au films sputtered onto quartz glass substrates has been studied by using a muon spin rotation technique. The fraction of muons stopped in the metal was determined by measuring the energy dependence of the μ+ decay asymmetry which is essentially proportional to the fraction of μ+ stopping in the metal layer. From this quantity also the backscattering probability from the metallic layer can be obtained. The results are compared with predictions of implantation profiles of muons obtained with the TRIM.SP and SRIM2000 Monte Carlo codes. The applicability of these simulations to predict the interaction of low energy muons in matter and observed differences with the experimental data are discussed."

At implantation energies 1.3keV≤E≤23.3keV, we compare the measured diamagnetic μ+ signal fraction fdia. against predictions derived from implantation profile simulations using the TRIM.SP Monte Carlo code. Treating the implanted μ+ as light protons p+, we find that simulations making use of updated stopping cross section data are in good agreement with the LE-μSR measurements, in contrast to parameterizations found in earlier tabulations. Implications for other studies relying on accurate μ+ stopping information are discussed.}
