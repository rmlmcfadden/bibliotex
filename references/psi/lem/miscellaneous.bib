	abstract = {A new data acquisition system (DAQ) for bulk μSR and low-energy μSR (LE-μSR) has been developed at PSI. It is based on commercial and in-house VME modules, and on the MIDAS DAQ software library. The system is able to cope with the different needs of the various PSI μSR spectrometers, which was not possible with the existing CAMAC and ORTEC's pTA-clock based DAQ systems. The VME clock is a 64-channel CAEN V1190 TDC, using the CERN HPTDC chip, with programmable time resolution of 25, 100, 200 or 800ps. The TDC onboard memory is continuously read through the VME bus by standard PC's or dedicated servers, using a 1-Gbit/s SIS3100/1100 VME–PCI interface. Detector rates are independently monitored using a 32-channel SIS3820 scaler module. In-house developed modules comprise an 8-channel constant fraction discriminator CFD950, a CD950 clock divider, an 8-channel linear fan-out SP950, a 16-channel NIM-ECL level converter LC950, and a programmable coincidence module FC950. All modules feature a superior performance compared to commercially available devices which allows their use also in the planned high-field μSR spectrometer where a time resolution of about 100ps is envisaged. A special external hardware logic is no longer required, since the system can deal with a rate total of 5MHz which is sufficient for μSR spectrometers with high event rate in their active veto systems.}

	% abstract = {The PSI low-energy μSR spectrometer is an instrument dedicated to muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements. Knowledge of the muon beam parameters such as spatial, kinetic energy and arrival-time distributions at the sample position are important ingredients to analyze the μSR spectra. We present here the measured energy losses in the thin carbon foil of the muon start detector deduced from time-of-flight measurements. Muonium formation in the thin carbon foil (10 nm thickness) of the muon start detector also affect the measurable decay asymmetry and therefore need to be accounted for. Muonium formation and energy losses in the start detector, whose relevance increase with decreasing muon implantation energy (<10 keV), have been implemented in Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation to reproduce the measured time-of-flight spectra. Simulated and measured time-of-flight and beam spot agrees only if a small fraction of so called ``unmoderated'' muons which contaminate the mono-energetic muon beam of the μSR spectrometer is introduced. Moreover the sensitivity of the beam size and related upstream-downstream asymmetry for a specially shaped ``nose'' sample plate has been studied for various beam line settings, which is of relevance for the study of thermal muonium emission into vacuum from mesoporous silica at cryogenic temperatures.}

	abstract = "The low-energy muon facility at PSI provides nearly fully polarized positive muons with tunable energies in the keV range to carry out muon spin rotation (LE-$$\upmu $$SR) experiments with nanometer depth resolution on thin films, heterostructures, and near-surface regions. The low-energy muon beam is focused and transported to the sample by electrostatic lenses. In order to achieve a minimum beam spot size at the sample position and to enable the steering of the beam in the horizontal and vertical direction, a special electrostatic device has been implemented close to the sample position. It consists of a cylinder at ground potential followed by four conically shaped electrodes, which can be operated at different electric potential. In LE-$$\upmu $$SR experiments, an electric field at the sample along the beam direction can be applied to accelerate/decelerate muons to different energies (0.5–30 keV). Additionally, a horizontal or vertical magnetic field can be superimposed for transverse or longitudinal field $$\upmu $$SR experiments. The focusing properties of the conical lens in the presence of these additional electric and magnetic fields have been investigated and optimized by Geant4 simulations. Some experimental tests were also performed and show that the simulation well describes the experimental setup.",

	% abstract = {In the context of µSR studies on magnetic materials in the ordered state, often a strong initial depolarization is found in the zero field spectra. For transverse field measurements this is often referred to as a loss in asymmetry. In case of the low-energy µSR (LE-µSR) setup this needs a more detailed discussion since effects such as time-of-flight distribution of impinging muons, back scattering, and muon reflection will change the spectra at early times and low implantation energies (E &lt; 3keV). These effects are well understood and reproducible allowing to correct for in any given experiment. We will discuss them and show how to correct for in experiments at low implantation energies.}

It is designed such that it can handle large area thin film samples with a future possibility to transfer them in vacuum directly to the low energy muons (LEM) spectrometer or to other advanced characterization facilities in the Quantum Matter and Materials Center (QMMC) which will be constructed in 2024. Initial commissioning of the chamber resulted in high quality, large area and uniform molecular films of CuPc and TbPc2 on various substrate materials. We present first results from low energy µSR (LE-µSR) measurements on these films.}

However, because of the large beam spot and low implanted muons rate, LE-μSR measurements on small samples are difficult, requiring an optimal sample size of 25×25mm2. Recently, we have boosted our ability to measure small samples, down to 5×5mm2 area, by beam collimation and tuning. This achievement is crucial for the measurements of many magnetic and superconducting materials. Furthermore, we have devised a method that allows us to measure five small area samples mounted together on the same sample plate. We expect this method to further improve the efficient use of beam time at LEM.}
