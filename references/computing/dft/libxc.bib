   abstract = "The central quantity of density functional theory is the so-called exchange–correlation functional. This quantity encompasses all non-trivial many-body effects of the ground-state and has to be approximated in any practical application of the theory. For the past 50 years, hundreds of such approximations have appeared, with many successfully persisting in the electronic structure community and literature. Here, we present a library that contains routines to evaluate many of these functionals (around 180) and their derivatives. Program summary Program title: LIBXC Catalogue identifier: AEMU_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEMU_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 87455 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 945365 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C with Fortran bindings. Computer: All. Operating system: All. RAM: N.A. Classification: 7.3, 16.1. Nature of problem: Evaluation of the exchange–correlation energy functional and its derivatives. This is a fundamental part of any atomic, molecular, or solid-state code that uses density-functional theory. Solution method: The values of the energy functional and its derivatives are given in a real grid of mesh points. Running time: Typically much smaller than the remainder of the electronic structure code. The running time has a natural linear scaling with the number of grid points."

   abstract = "libxc is a library of exchange–correlation functionals for density-functional theory. We are concerned with semi-local functionals (or the semi-local part of hybrid functionals), namely local-density approximations, generalized-gradient approximations, and meta-generalized-gradient approximations. Currently we include around 400 functionals for the exchange, correlation, and the kinetic energy, spanning more than 50 years of research. Moreover, libxc is by now used by more than 20 codes, not only from the atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics, but also from the quantum chemistry communities."
