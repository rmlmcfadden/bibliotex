The method is based on the gauge including projector augmented wave approach of Pickard and Mauri [Phys. Rev. B 63, 245101 (2001)]. Relativistic effects are included at the level of the scalar-relativistic zeroth-order regular approximation. The method allows chemical shifts of large, low symmetry structures containing heavy elements to be calculated efficiently. We demonstrate its success for a range of Se and Te containing molecules.},

	% abstract = {A method to calculate NMR J-coupling constants from first principles in extended systems is presented. It is based on density functional theory and is formulated within a planewave-pseudopotential framework. The all-electron properties are recovered using the projector augmented wave approach. The method is validated by comparison with existing quantum chemical calculations of solution-state systems and with experimental data. The approach has also been applied to the silicophosphate, Si5O(PO4)6, giving P31–Si29-couplings which are in excellent agreement with experiment.},
