	abstract = {A family of segmented contracted basis sets is proposed, denoted pcSseg-n, which are optimized for calculating nuclear magnetic shielding constants. For the elements H–Ar, these are computationally more efficient than the previously proposed general contracted pcS-n basis sets, and the new basis sets are extended to also include the elements K–Kr. The pcSseg-n basis sets are optimized at the density functional level of theory, but it has been shown previously that these property-optimized basis sets are also suitable for calculating shielding constants with correlated wave function methods. The pcSseg-n basis sets are available in qualities ranging from (unpolarized) double-ζ to pentuple-ζ quality and should be suitable for both routine and benchmark calculations of nuclear magnetic shielding constants. The ability to rigorously separate basis set and method errors should aid in developing more accurate methods.}
