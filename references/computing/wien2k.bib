   abstract = "To study solid materials on the atomic scale one often starts with an ideal crystal at zero temperature and calculates its electronic structure by means of density functional theory (DFT). This allows a quantum mechanical treatment of the physics that underlines properties such as relative stability, chemical bonding, relaxation of the atoms, phase transitions, electrical, mechanical, optical or magnetic behavior, etc. For the solution of the DFT equations several methods have been developed. The linearized-augmented-plane-wave method is one of the most accurate methods. It is embodied in the computer code––WIEN2k––which is now used worldwide by more than 500 groups to solve crystal properties on the atomic scale (see www.wien2k.at). Nowadays calculations of this type can be done––on sufficiently powerful computers––for systems containing about 100 atoms per unit cell. Chromium dioxide CrO2 is selected as a representative example using both, bulk and surface structures. References to other applications are given."

   abstract = "Due to the increased computer power and advanced algorithms, quantum mechanical calculations based on Density Functional Theory are more and more widely used to solve real materials science problems. In this context large nonlinear generalized eigenvalue problems must be solved repeatedly to calculate the electronic ground state of a solid or molecule. Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, an iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem can be more efficient provided it does not disturb the convergence of the self-consistent-field problem. The blocked Davidson method is one of the widely used and efficient schemes for that purpose, but its performance depends critically on the preconditioning, i.e. the procedure to improve the search space for an accurate solution. For more diagonally dominated problems, which appear typically for plane wave based pseudopotential calculations, the inverse of the diagonal of (H−ES) is used. However, for the more efficient “augmented plane wave+local-orbitals” basis set this preconditioning is not sufficient due to large off-diagonal terms caused by the local orbitals. We propose a new preconditioner based on the inverse of (H−λS) and demonstrate its efficiency for real applications using both, a sequential and a parallel implementation of this algorithm into our WIEN2k code."

Different facets that are relevant for material sciences are discussed, ranging from quantum mechanics to the augmented plane wave (APW) method, as well as improvements in computer hardware and algorithms and related numerical accuracy. In this long period, the complexity and realism of applications to condensed matter systems has significantly increased and many properties which are closely related to experiments can now be calculated. This progress is illustrated by the fact that WIEN2k now is used worldwide by more than 1600 groups. The major steps in this development are illustrated for a few selected examples.}

This is done by numerically solving the Schrödinger equation. The most expensive part of such calculations in terms of consumption of computational resources is the numerical solution of hermitian (or symmetric) generalized eigenvalue problems that involve large matrices up to dimensions of 100.000 - depending on the complexity of the material. Therefore, efficient use of HPC systems is critical to be able to run such calculations in a reasonable time. In this work the present performance of parallel eigensolver schemes already implemented in WIEN2k is evaluated in order to find bottlenecks.},

In this context, different aspects need to be discussed, such as the details of the atomic structure, the quantum mechanical treatment of the electronic structure, which is mainly based on density functional theory (DFT), the computer codes for solving DFT, the parameters that determine the accuracy of the results, and various properties that can be derived from DFT calculations. This chapter introduces these simulation techniques and illustrates, for selected examples, which insights can be gained in structure–property relations.}
