   abstract = "On the basis of the ideas, proposed by one of the authors (I.N. Silin), a suitable software has been developed for constrained data fitting. Constraints may be of arbitrary type; i.e. equalities and inequalities. The simplest possible way has been used. The widely known program FUMILI was re-written in the C++ language. Constraints in the form of inequalities φ(θ)≥a were taken into account by changing them into equalities φ(θ)=t and simple inequalities of type t≥a. The equalities were taken into account by means of quadratic penalty functions. The suitable software was tested on the model data for the ANKE setup (COSY accelerator, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany)."

   abstract = "The suggested FUMILI package development has the following advantages: a more convenient and friendly user interface; no limit on the number of parameters and experimental points; speed advantage when the number of parameters is high enough; there are options to ignore wrong experimental points and correct experimental errors. The preliminary scan is envisaged for complicated tasks. All programs are written in FORTRAN-77. The investigation has been performed at the Veksler and Baldin Laboratory of High Energy Physics, JINR."
