   abstract = {A family of numerical quadrature formulas is introduced by application of the trapezoidal rule to infinite integrals which result from the given integrals  ∫ ba f(x)dx by suitable variable transformations x = ø(u). These formulas are characterized by having double exponential asymptotic behavior of the integrands in the resulting infinite integrals as u → ± ∞, and it is shown both analytically and numerically that such formulas are generally optimal with respect to the ecomony of the number of sampling points.}

   abstract = "The double-exponential transformation was first proposed by Takahasi and Mori in 1974 for the efficient evaluation of integrals of an analytic function with end-point singularity. Afterwards, this transformation was improved for the evaluation of oscillatory functions like Fourier integrals. Recently, it turned out that the double-exponential transformation is useful not only for numerical integration but also for various kinds of Sinc numerical methods. The purpose of the present paper is to review the double-exponential transformation in numerical integration and in a variety of Sinc numerical methods."
