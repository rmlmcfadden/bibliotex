   abstract = {A family of numerical quadrature formulas is introduced by application of the trapezoidal rule to infinite integrals which result from the given integrals  ∫ ba f(x)dx by suitable variable transformations x = ø(u). These formulas are characterized by having double exponential asymptotic behavior of the integrands in the resulting infinite integrals as u → ± ∞, and it is shown both analytically and numerically that such formulas are generally optimal with respect to the ecomony of the number of sampling points.}

    abstract = {A double exponential transformation is presented to obtain a quadrature formula for Fourier-type integrals ∫0∞f(x)sinωxdx or ∫0∞f(x)cosωxdx where f(x) is a slowly decaying analytic function on (0,∞). It is an improved version of what we previously proposed in 1991. The transformation x=φ(t) is such that it maps the interval (0,∞) onto (−∞,∞), and that, while the integrand after the transformation decreases double exponentially at large negative t, the points of the formula approaches to zeros of sinωx or cosωx double exponentially at large positive t. Then the trapezoidal formula with an equal mesh size is applied to the integral over (−∞,∞) after the transformation, which gives an efficient quadrature formula for the Fourier-type integrals. The present transformation is improved in the sense that it can integrate a function f(z) with singularities in the finite z-plane more efficiently than the one previously proposed.}

   abstract = "The double-exponential transformation was first proposed by Takahasi and Mori in 1974 for the efficient evaluation of integrals of an analytic function with end-point singularity. Afterwards, this transformation was improved for the evaluation of oscillatory functions like Fourier integrals. Recently, it turned out that the double-exponential transformation is useful not only for numerical integration but also for various kinds of Sinc numerical methods. The purpose of the present paper is to review the double-exponential transformation in numerical integration and in a variety of Sinc numerical methods."
