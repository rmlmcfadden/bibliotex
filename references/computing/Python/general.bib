   abstract = {As the relationship between research and computing evolves, new tools are required to not only treat numerical problems, but also to solve various problems that involve large datasets in different formats, new algorithms, and computational systems such as databases and Internet servers. Python can help develop these computational research tools by providing a balance of clarity and flexibility without sacrificing performance.},
