We present a new empirical fit, quite different in form, which is accurate to within ±0.01% for any combination of Lorentz (pressure) and doppler line widths. We also show a simple modification to the expression given by Whiting which attains an accuracy of approx. ±0.02%."

   abstract = "Methods for computing the complex probability function w(z) = e−z2 erfc (−iz), which is related to the Voigt spectrum line profiles, are developed. The basic method is a rational approximation, minimizing the relative error of the imaginary part on the real axis. It is complemented by other methods in order to increase efficiency and to overcome the inevitable failure of any rational approximation near the real axis. The procedures enable one to evaluate both real and imaginary parts of w(z) with high relative accuracy. The methods are simple, as demonstrated by a sample FORTRAN program."

The approach allows greater computational speed to be obtained if the maximum relative error criteria can be relaxed. A supplementary algorithm to calculate the partial derivatives of the Voigt function simultaneously with the Faddeeva function is also specified."
