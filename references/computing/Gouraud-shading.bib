	abstract = {A procedure for computing shaded pictures of curved surfaces is presented. The surface is approximated by small polygons in order to solve easily the hidden-parts problem, but the shading of each polygon is computed so that discontinuities of shade are eliminated across the surface and a smooth appearance is obtained. In order to achieve speed efficiency, the technique developed by Watkins is used which makes possible a hardware implementation of this algorithm.},

This time I'll tell you about a way to use them to interpolate various parameters properly when tiling polygons. The exact definition of "properly" comes from one of those things that homogeneous coordinates are good at-perspective.},
