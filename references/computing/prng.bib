   abstract = "This is a brief review of the current situation concerning practical pseudorandom number generation for Monte Carlo calculations. The conclusion is that pseudorandom number generators with the required properties are now available, but the generators actually used are often not good enough. Portable Fortran code is given for three different pseudorandom number generators, all of which have much better properties than any of the traditional generators commonly supplied in most program libraries."

   abstract = "Following some remarks on the quality of pseudorandom number generators commonly used in Monte Carlo calculations in computational physics, we offer a portable Fortran 77 implementation of a high-quality generator called RANLUX (for LUXury RANdom numbers), using the algorithm of Martin Lüscher described in an accompanying article. The implementation allows the user to select different quality or luxury levels, where higher quality requires somewhat longer computing time for the generation. There is a convenient way of initialization (appropriate also for massively parallel Monte Carlo computations) as well as two different methods of restarting from a break point."

All the RNG’s we recommend here are based on the Kolmogorov–Anosov theory of mixing in classical mechanical systems, which guarantees under certain conditions and in certain asymptotic limits, that points on the trajectories of these systems can be used to produce random number sequences of exceptional quality. We outline this theory of mixing and establish criteria for deciding which RNG’s are sufficiently good approximations to the ideal mathematical systems that guarantee highest quality. The well-known RANLUX (at highest luxury level) and its recent variant RANLUX++ are seen to meet our criteria, and some of the proposed versions of MIXMAX can be modified easily to meet the same criteria.",
