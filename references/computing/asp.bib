   abstract = "In the paper new methods to separate useful information from background in one, two, three and multidimensional spectra (histograms) measured in large multidetector γ-ray arrays are derived. The sensitive nonlinear peak clipping algorithm is the basis of the methods for estimation of the background in multidimensional spectra. The derived procedures are simple and therefore have a very low cost in terms of computing time."

   author = "Miroslav Morháč and Ján Kliman and Vladislav Matoušek and Martin Veselský and Ivan Turzo",
   abstract = "The use of deconvolution operation makes it possible to improve the resolution in γ-ray spectra. The paper describes a non-oscillating method of Gold deconvolution. The method is generalized for multidimensional spectra. A new optimized algorithm of one- and two-dimensional Gold deconvolution aimed to reduce number of computer operations has been derived in the paper."

   abstract = "In the paper a new algorithm to find peaks in two, three and multidimensional spectra, measured in large multidetector γ-ray arrays, is derived. Given the dimension m, the algorithm is selective to m-fold coincidence peaks. It is insensitive to intersections of lower-fold coincidences, hereinafter called ridges."
