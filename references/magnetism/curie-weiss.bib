	abstract = "Magnetic susceptibility measurements are often the first characterization tool that researchers turn to when beginning to assess the magnetic nature of a newly discovered material. Breakthroughs in instrumentation have made the collection of high quality magnetic susceptibility data more accessible than ever before. However, the analysis of susceptibility data remains a common challenge for newcomers to the field of magnetism. While a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical aspects of magnetism are found in numerous excellent textbooks, there is a gap at the point of practical application. We were inspired by this obstacle to put together this guide to the analysis and interpretation of magnetic susceptibility data, with an emphasis on materials that exhibit Curie-Weiss paramagnetism.",
