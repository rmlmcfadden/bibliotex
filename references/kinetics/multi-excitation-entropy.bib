   abstract = {In this paper it is argued that the generality of the Meyer-Neldel rule compels one to adopt a phenomenological approach if a universally valid model is aimed at. It is shown that there exists only one possible phenomenological model. This model is based on an exponential probability distribution of energy barriers. The model predicts a power-law frequency dependence of the AC conductivity with the exponent s given by s=1-T/T0 where T0 is the characteristic temperature of the Meyer-Neldel rule. It is conjectured that the exponential energy barrier distribution derives from a 'glass transition' at T0. The generalisation of the model to account for the compensation effect in other contexts is briefly discussed, using the case of heterogeneous catalysis as an example.}

In materials that show a disordering transition in the mobile ion sublattice, a correlation exists between the magnitudes of the enthalpy and entropy of activation obtained from conductivity data for the low temperature, ordered region. This correlation accounts for the Meyer-Neldel rule, an exponential correlation between conductivity pre-exponential factor and activation enthalpy observed in families of related materials. In the low temperature, ordered region of solid electrolyte behaviour, significant entropy terms give rise to enhanced ion hopping rates: it is proposed that this phenomenon be taken as an operational definition of “fast ion conduction”."

   abstract = {This review concerns the concept of multi-excitation entropy (MEE) and its consequences. When a fluctuation involving a large number of excitations occurs, for example, when a large activation barrier is overcome, there must be a large entropy associated with this fluctuation. First, the concepts of free energy and entropy, of activated processes and the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are reviewed. The tendency to neglect entropy, whose value is difficult to determine, in modelling kinetic processes, is briefly discussed. We then present a review of the experimental observations of the phenomenon which is variously known as the Compensation Law, the Isokinetic Rule and the Meyer–Neldel Rule (MNR). These observations include examples from chemistry, condensed matter physics, biology and geology. Arguments are then presented for the importance of entropy and particularly of MEE in both kinetics and thermodynamics, when activation energies are large. After a discussion of non-entropic models of compensation, we present results which support the MEE model as an explanation of MNR. The behaviour of systems with low activation energies, or at high temperatures, to which the MEE model does not apply, is then discussed. Several consequences of MEE, including applications to the interpretation of experimental data, particularly the unification of models of dc and ac electrical properties of materials are considered. The high temperature behaviour of systems which obey the MNR at low temperature is then explained, and the idea of a total entropy, of which the MEE is a part, is introduced, as is the correlation between the two empirical parameters encountered in MNR. Finally, these ideas lead to verified predictions of reasonable values of attempt frequencies and cross sections in kinetic processes, which initially appear unreasonable.}

It is shown that the most appropriate analysis technique depends critically on the error structure of the kinetic data.

Secondly{,} analysis of kinetic data when the Arrhenius parameters depend on another parameter is examined. In the case of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments when the activation energy depends on surface coverage{,} it is shown that a common analysis method induces a systematic error{,} causing an apparent compensation effect. Thirdly{,} the effect of analysing the temperature dependence of an overall rate of reaction{,} rather than a rate constant{,} is investigated. It is shown that this can create an apparent compensation effect{,} but only under some conditions. This result is illustrated by a case study for a unimolecular reaction on a catalyst surface. Overall{,} the work highlights the fact that{,} whenever a kinetic compensation effect is observed experimentally{,} the possibility of it having a mathematical origin should be carefully considered before any physicochemical conclusions are drawn."

Charge transfer then occurs when atoms' classical movements bring the electronic energy levels for a carrier at initial and final sites into temporary coincidence. Without rapid relaxation of a coincidence, dissipating vibrational energy away from the involved sites, an adiabatic hop is likely to be followed by a return hop. The lowering of the vibrational frequencies associated with a carrier's back-and-forth motion between sites augments the vibrational entropy of the hop's activated state. The proportionality of the additional vibrational entropy to the hop's activation energy, the minimum energy needed to produce a coincidence, establishes the Meyer--Neldel compensation effect.",
