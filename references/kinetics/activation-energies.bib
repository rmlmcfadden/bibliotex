	abstract = {This paper draws attention to selected experiments on enzyme-catalyzed reactions that show convex Arrhenius plots, which are very rare, and points out that Tolman{\textquoteright}s interpretation of the activation energy places a fundamental model-independent constraint on any detailed explanation of these reactions. The analysis presented here shows that in such systems, the rate coefficient as a function of energy is not just increasing more slowly than expected, it is actually decreasing. This interpretation of the data provides a constraint on proposed microscopic models, i.e., it requires that any successful model of a reaction with a convex Arrhenius plot should be consistent with the microcanonical rate coefficient being a decreasing function of energy. The implications and limitations of this analysis to interpreting enzyme mechanisms are discussed. This model-independent conclusion has broad applicability to all fields of kinetics, and we also draw attention to an analogy with diffusion in metastable fluids and glasses.

	abstract = {Recent advances in the calculation and interpretation of the activation energy for a dynamical process are described. Specifically, new approaches that apply the fluctuation theory of statistical mechanics to dynamics enable the direct determination of the activation energy for an arbitrary dynamical time scale from simulations at a single temperature. This opens up significant new possibilities for understanding activated processes in cases where a traditional Arrhenius analysis is not possible. The methods also enable a rigorous decomposition of the activation energy into contributions associated with the different interactions and motions present in the system. These components can be understood in the context of Tolmanâ€™s interpretation of the activation energy. Specifically, they provide insight into how energy can be most effectively deposited to accelerate the dynamics of interest, promising important new mechanistic information for a broad range of chemical processes. The general approach can be extended beyond activation energies to the examination of non-Arrhenius behavior as well as the changes in dynamical time scales with respect to other thermodynamic variables such as pressure.}
