   abstract = "Magnesium-25 nuclear magnetic resonance is studied in aqueous solutions of molecules containing phosphate groups which bind magnesium ion. The line width of magnesium ion in 1.5 M magnesium chloride solutions is 3.8 ± 0.5 Hz and is significantly broadened by the addition of phosphate-containing molecules such as ATP. The line broadening is shown to contain effects due to the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction as well as effects due to chemical exchange of the magnesium ion between complexed and uncomplexed sites in solution. The chemical exchange rate of magnesium ion with ATP is measured to be 2 × 10° sec−1 at 25°C, an ionic strength of 4.5 and pH of 7.9. The possibility of using magnesium-25 nuclear magnetic resonance to study magnesium ion interactions with enzymes is examined."

The results are compared with those obtained from salts of adenosine 5′-monophosphate and other simpler phosphomonoesters, e.g. AMP2−2(Me4N+), AMP2−Mg2+, AMPH−Me4N+ and (AMPH−)2Mg2+. It is concluded that the effects exerted by Mg2+ and Ca2+ on the 31P NMR shifts of dipoly- and tripolyphosphates relative to monovalent cations are due mainly to changes in conformation of the polyphosphate chain rather than to purely electronic factors associated with the binding of divalent cations to the phospho-oxyanions. The data are consistent with the existence of the following complexes at p2H 8.20: (MgPαPβ)ADP− and (MgPαPγ)ATP2−af (MgPαPβ)ATP2−af (MgPβPγ)ATP2− with the latter equilibrium relatively fast in the NMR time scale. Monoprotonation of the terminal phosphate appears to weaken the Mg2+-polyphosphate binding, particularly at Pβ of MgADPH and at Pβ and Pγ of MgATPH−. The Mg2+-polyphosphate binding weakens further at p2H 3.70, i.e. in MgATPH2. Possible implications of the results in the mechanism of actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase in muscle contraction are discussed."

The 25Mg NMR spectra of the Mg2+-ATP (or ADP) complex are remarkably broadened in the ternary Mg2+-ATP(or ADP)-creatine kinase complex in contrast with previous prediction. From temperature dependence of the spectra of the protein-bound ion, it is suggested that Mg2+ of the protein-bound Mg2+-ATP(or ADP) complex is not in the fast exchange regime. The 25Mg NMR signal of the transition state analogue complex is narrower and less temperature-dependent than those of the ternary complex, suggesting that Mg2+ in the transition state analogue complex is in a more symmetrical environment or exchanges slower than that of the ternary complex."

The parameters are interpreted to support a model of inner sphere complexation of the metal cations to the phosphate groups with no evidence of metal-ring interaction in the ML complexes.

    abstract = {Solution structures of M(ATP)2− complexes are reviewed. First the self-stacking properties of ATP4− and M(ATP)2− are shortly described. It is emphasized that for an evaluation of solution structures of M(ATP)2− complexes only results from diluted solutions (below 1 mM) should be used. Next, a comprehensive set of stability data obtained under such conditions from potentiometric pH titrations is summarized for the complexes of Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ with ATP, and for comparison also with pyrimidine nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (YTPs), i.e. CTP, UTP and TTP. The stabilities for the M(ATP)2− complexes are mostly larger than those for the corresponding M(YTP)2− species; this increased stability results from the metal ion back-binding to the base residue in M(ATP)2−, i.e. macrochelates are formed. Detailed analysis of the stability data allows calculation of the percentage of the closed form for the several M(ATP)2− complexes: back-binding is most pronounced in Cu(ATP)2− (67 ± 2\%), remarkable in Zn(ATP)2− (28 ± 7\%), and not observable for Ca(ATP)2− (2 ± 6\%). Comparison of these results with those from 1H-NMR and ultraviolet spectrophotometric studies allows the conclusion that two types of base back-bound macrochelates are formed: one with a direct, i.e. innersphere, M2+/N-7 coordination, and one with a water molecule between the metal ion and N-7, i.e. an outersphere interaction occurs [e.g. to about 10\% in Mg(ATP)2−] through hydrogen bonding of a coordinated water to N-7. The formation degree of both forms of these closed isomers is quantified. The biological implications of these results are indicated and the versatility of ATP as a ligand is discussed by summarizing pertinent examples.},

Addition of any of these ligands to a solution of 2 mM25MgCl at pH 7.2 caused a progressive increase in linewidth, with no discernible chemical shift. ATP and ADP, which form tight 1:1 complexes with Mg2+, did not cause maximal broadening until present in several-fold excess, implying that bis(nucleotide) complexes also form. The studies showed progressively weaker Mg2+ binding to ATP, ADP, DPG, and AMP, consistent with published binding constants. Hemoglobin cause fairly little broadening, consistent with its known weak affinity for Mg2+. Competition studies determined ATP affinities for Ca2+ and H+ that were also in good agreement with published values. 25Mg NMR spectra of 2 mM bound 25Mg2+ were obtained with good signal to noise in less than 1 hr. The technique may now be a practical means for studying the binding of Mg2+ within erythrocytes and other cells."

The enthalpies of reaction of Mg2+ with ADP and ATP were obtained from the heats of mixing of aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonium salts of ADP and ATP with MgCl2 solutions in an isothermal flow calorimeter. Equilibrium constant (K), enthalpy change ($\Delta$H{\textdegree}), entropy change ($\Delta$S{\textdegree}), and heat capacity change ($\Delta$Cp{\textdegree}) values were calculated for the interaction: Mg2++Ln−=MgL2−n and Mg2++MgL2−n=Mg2L4−n, where n=4 for L=ATP and n=3 for L=ADP. The results are consistent with those at lower temperatures. For the two nucleotides studied, the above two reactions are endothermic and entropy-driven in the temperature range studied. Large $\Delta$Cp{\textdegree} values for the interaction of Mg2+ with ADP with ATP indicate the involvement of phosphate groups of nucleotides in the coordination of Mg2+. The coordination of the first and second Mg2+ ions involves the phosphate chain in both ADP and ATP. No evidence was found for the involvement of the adenine ring or the ribose moiety in the coordination of Mg2+ with these nucleotides. Approximate values of logK, $\Delta$H{\textdegree}, and $\Delta$S{\textdegree}, and $\Delta$Cp{\textdegree} for the self-association of ADP and ATP in the presence of Mg2+ are also given.",

   abstract = {Abstract 25Mg NMR relaxation has been applied to characterize the kinetic and dynamic parameters in the complexation process of the Mg2+ ion with adenosine triphosphate. A modified linear prediction with singular value decomposition method developed earlier is used to obtain the preliminary chemical shift separation between the free 25Mg2+ ion and the 25Mg2+-ATP complex. Then the 25Mg2+ NMR null point spectra is invoked to find the chemical shift separation and the quadrupolar coupling constant of the complex. With the knowledge of those parameters, T1 and line width data at 30.62 MHz and 18.37 MHz can be analyzed to determine the correlation times for the fluctuation of electric field gradient at 25Mg and the dissociation rate constants of the complex at the temperature range of 270–320 K. An activation energy of 8.8 kcal/mol for dissociation rate constant is obtained. It is also found that the reorientational motion of the 25Mg2+-ATP complex is not significantly affected by the formation of ATP aggregates. A similar conclusion is further obtained by comparing the T1 data of β-31P in ATP and Mg2+-ATP solutions.},

The interactions of various metal ions with adenosine nucleotides have been intensively studied by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Nucleotides are polydentate ligands with various potential binding sites, including nitrogen atoms on the purine base, hydroxyl groups on the ribose sugar, and negatively charged oxygen atoms in the phosphate group. Depending on the experimental conditions (e.g. pH, concentration range, etc.) and on the size and nature of the metal ions, monodentate, or multidentate coordination to these donor atoms are possible. The review focuses on the applications of different NMR techniques in identifying the stoichiometry and the mode of metal binding in complexes formed with the most important adenosine nucleotides, like adenosine-5′-mono-, di- and triphosphates (AMP, ADP and ATP). Ligand exchange dynamics for some metal ion complexes are also presented."

These proteins use cofactors such as nucleoside di and tri-phosphates (NTP, NDP) and can detect the difference between NDP and NTP which then induce different protein conformations. Mechanisms that drive proteins into the NTP or NDP conformation may depend on factors such as ligand structure and how Mg2+ coordinates with the ligand, amino acids in the pocket and water molecules. Here, we have used the advanced electrostatic and polarisable force field AMOEBA and molecular dynamics free energy simulations (MDFE) to examine the various binding mechanisms of ATP:Mg2+ and ADP:Mg2+. We compared the ATP:Mg2+ binding with previous studies using non-polarisable force fields and experimental data on the binding affinity. It was found that the total free energy of binding for ATP:Mg2+ (−7.00 ± 2.13 kcal/mol) is in good agreement with experimental values (−8.6 ± .2 kcal/mol) [1]. In addition, parameters for relevant protonation states of ATP, ADP, GTP and GDP have been derived. These parameters will allow for researchers to investigate biochemical phenomena involving NTP’s and NDP’s with greater accuracy than previous studies involving non-polarisable force fields.}
