    abstract = "25Mg+2 ion NMR studies of complexes of magnesium ions with acetate and malonate ligands have yielded apparent quadrupolar coupling constants, χ , of approximately 1.5 MHz. The aquo magnesium ion yields a smaller χ value of 0.12 MHz, consistent with its expected higher symmetry. χ values for magnesium ion:acetate and magnesium ion:malonate complexes are utilized to calculate observed linewidths for magnesium ion:bovine prothrombin fragment 1 and magn These calculated values are compared with observed values and implications of the agreement are discussed."
