	abstract = {We used 7Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation times and 31P NMR chemical shifts to study the binding of Li+ and Mg2+ to the phosphate moieties of ATP and ADP. To examine the binding of Li+ and Mg2+ to the base and ribose moieties, we used 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts. The 7Li NMR relaxation times of Li+/Mg3+ mixtures of ATP or ADP increased with increasing concentrations of Mg2+, suggesting competition between the two ions for adenine nucleotides. No significant binding of Li+ and Mg2+ to the base and ribose moieties occurred. At the pH and ionic strength used, 2:1 and 1:1 species of the Li+-ATP and Li+-ADP complexes were present, with the 2:1 species predominating. In contrast, 1:1 species predominated for the Mg2+-ADP and Mg2+-ATP complexes. We calculated the Li+-nucleotide binding constants in the presence and absence of Mg2+ and found them to be somewhat greater in the presence of Mg2+. Although competition between Li+ and Mg2+ for ATP and ADP phosphate binding sites in solution is consistent with the 31P chemical shift data, the possibility that the Li+ and Mg2+ form mixed complexes with the phosphate groups of ATP or ADP cannot be ruled out.}

	abstract = {Background: Lithium, in the form of a salt, is a mood stabilizer and a leading drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has a very narrow therapeutic range and a variety of side effects. Lithium can replace magnesium and other cations in enzymes and small molecules, among them ATP, thereby affecting and inhibiting many biochemical pathways. The form of binding of lithium ions to ATP is not known. Methods: Here we extract the binding environment of lithium in solid ATP using a multi-nuclear multi-dimensional solid-state NMR approach. Results: We determine that the coordination sphere of lithium includes, at a distance of 3.0(±0.4) Å, three phosphates; the two phosphates closest to the ribose ring from one ATP molecule, and the middle phosphate from another ATP molecule. A water molecule most probably completes the fourth coordination. Despite the use of excess lithium in the preparations, sodium ions still remain bound to the sample, at distances of 4.3–5.5 Å from Li, and coordinate the first phosphate and two terminal phosphates. Conclusions: Solid-state NMR enables to unravel the exact coordination of lithium in ATP showing binding to three phosphates from two molecules, none of which are the terminal gamma phosphate. General significance: The methods we use are applicable to study lithium bound to a variety of ATP-bound enzymes, or to other cellular targets of lithium, consequently suggesting a molecular basis for its mode of action.}
