   abstract = {25Mg NMR spectroscopy is applied to a study of magnesium ion interactions with DNA, which is considered as a model for a linear polyelectrolyte. It is demonstrated that the magnesium ion spectrum is complicated by a non-Lorent-zian line shape and is dominated by the effects of chemical exchange with macromolecule binding sites. A distinction is made between specific-site interactions in which the magnesium ion loses a water molecule from the first coordination sphere on binding and those interactions, referred to as territorial binding, in which the ion maintains its first coordination sphere complement of solvent. The first type of site-binding interactions are shown to dominate the magnesium ion NMR spectrum, based on a consideration of the magnitudes of the observed 25Mg relaxation rates compared with 23Na relaxation rates, the clear contributions of chemical exchange-limited relaxation, and an ion displacement experiment employing sodium.},

   abstract = {Abstract 25Mg-nmr data are reported that address the nature of the magnesium ion–DNA interaction. It is found that competitor ions such as calcium, mercury, zinc, and cobalt ions are not effective in competing for all of the magnesium ion–DNA interaction that is reported by the 25Mg-nmr spectrum. The temperature dependence of the 25Mg-nmr spectrum in DNA solution studied at high concentrations of competitor ion indicates that the chemical-exchange lifetime of the magnesium ions at DNA binding sites makes a major contribution to the 25Mg-nmr line width. However, the activation parameters are not consistent with the temperature dependence of either transport properties or chemical exchange with phosphate groups alone, but are consistent with a sum of at least two processes that provide opposing contributions to the 25Mg-nmr relaxation. It is also shown that the non-Lorentzian character of the 25Mg-nmr line previously reported is consistent with the effect of an incompletely averaged static nuclear electric quadrupole interaction and/or an exchange process that is slow with respect to the magnitude of this interaction. Because the concentrations employed in these experiments are high, the present data do not provide a direct or critical test of the electrostatic theories of ion–polyelectrolyte interaction. The present data do demonstrate, however, that such theories alone are insufficient as a basis for understanding the 25Mg-nmr data.},
