Many of the experimental data come from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique that allows internal motions to be probed with exquisite time and spatial resolution. Recent methodological advancements in NMR have extended our ability to characterize protein dynamics and promise to shed new light on the mechanisms by which these molecules function. Here, we present a brief overview of some of the new methods, together with applications that illustrate the level of detail at which protein motions can now be observed.},

   abstract = "Although biomolecular dynamics has been investigated using NMR for at least 40years, only in the past 20years have internal motions been characterized at atomic resolution throughout proteins and nucleic acids. This development was made possible by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR approaches that provide near complete sequential signal assignments of uniformly labeled biomolecules. Recent methodological advances have enabled characterization of internal dynamics on timescales ranging from picoseconds to seconds, both in solution and in the solid state. The size, complexity and functional significance of biomolecules investigated by NMR continue to grow, as do the insights that have been obtained about function. In this article I review a number of recent advances that have made such studies possible, and provide a few examples of where NMR either by itself or in combination with other approaches has paved the way to a better understanding of the complex relationship between dynamics and biomolecular function. Finally, I discuss prospects for further advances in this field."
