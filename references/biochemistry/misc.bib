    abstract = "It is shown that selective measurements of the magnetic dipole—dipole interactions between specific pairs of nuclear spins in glasses of concentrated aqueous electrolytes can provide detailed structural information of relevance to the liquid. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by selective measurements of the inter- and intra-molecular (H2O) proton—proton interactions in LiCl and LiBr solutions at 100 K. For LiCl,4H2O, these measurements are consistent with a short range (≈0.8 nm) distorted sodium chloride structure with Cl− and Li(H2O)+4 as basic units: each Cl− ion is octahedrally coordinated to six OH bonds. For LiCl,RH2O solutions in the composition range 4 <R < 10, the excess H2O is packed interstitially at the interfaces between clusters of LiCl,4H2O. This structure is consistent with various properties of the solution at room temperature. LiBr solutions have similar structures."

For this purpose, we have implemented a new module (CCR-DYANA) in a version of the program DYANA (PARAMAGNETIC-DYANA), which can be used together with other paramagnetism-based constraints such as pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings and hyperfine based Karplus relationships. This integrated structure calculation protocol has the advantage that different paramagnetic-based constraints are treated by the same algorithm in a way that the efficiency of each class of constraints can be analyzed and compared.",

    abstract = "Recent advances in the techniques that are used to design and prepare protein domains have led to the realization that several proteins, which are involved in important cellular processes, contain regions that are intrinsically unstructured in their normal, functional state.Disordered or unstructured regions are characterized by a compositional bias in their amino-acid sequence, in that they contain a significantly larger proportion of small and hydrophilic amino acids and proline residues than structured regions.Sequences with extreme compositional bias generally function as linkers between structured domains and are frequently the sites of disease-related gene truncations or translocations.The presence of unstructured or incompletely folded regions in proteins that are involved in signalling, transcriptional and translational processes can be rationalized in several ways --- for example, the requirement for binding with high specificity and reversibility, the requirement for binding to different partners (for example, if post-translational modification is necessary for control of function), and the requirement for rapid degradation when the signal is turned off.The folding of an unstructured domain on binding to its partner can result in the formation of a complex with an extremely large surface area of interaction. This provides a specificity that could not otherwise be obtained (except by increasing the size of the protein, with the consequent increases in metabolic burden on the cell).The coupled folding and binding of proteins allows a much greater range of possible interactions within the same set of proteins, and therefore provides versatility. For example, different signalling proteins can bind to a given receptor, potentiating different reactions, and a given signalling protein can bind to different receptors.",

Until internationally defined buffer standards are available, the lack of correlation between measured and calculated [X       <sup>2+</sup>] means that measurement of K       <sub>app</sub> and [Ligand]       <sub>T</sub> and hence [X       <sup>2+</sup>] is more reliable than calculation.",

The full range of functionally relevant GPCR conformations is poorly understood. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational dynamics of the transmembrane core of the ?2-adrenergic receptor (?2AR), a prototypical GPCR. We labeled ?2AR with 13CH3$\epsilon$-methionine and obtained HSQC spectra of unliganded receptor as well as receptor bound to an inverse agonist, an agonist, and a G-protein-mimetic nanobody. These studies provide evidence for conformational states not observed in crystal structures, as well as substantial conformational heterogeneity in agonist- and inverse-agonist-bound preparations. They also show that for ?2AR, unlike rhodopsin, an agonist alone does not stabilize a fully active conformation, suggesting that the conformational link between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling surface is not rigid. The observed heterogeneity may be important for ?2AR?s ability to engage multiple signaling and regulatory proteins.",

	abstract = {The design of functional membrane proteins from first principles represents a grand challenge in chemistry and structural biology. Here, we report the design of a membrane-spanning, four-helical bundle that transports first-row transition metal ions Zn2+ and Co2+, but not Ca2+, across membranes. The conduction path was designed to contain two di-metal binding sites that bind with negative cooperativity. X-ray crystallography and solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the overall helical bundle is formed from two tightly interacting pairs of helices, which form individual domains that interact weakly along a more dynamic interface. Vesicle flux experiments show that as Zn2+ ions diffuse down their concentration gradients, protons are antiported. These experiments illustrate the feasibility of designing membrane proteins with predefined structural and dynamic properties. The ability to design proteins gives insight into the relation between a protein{\textquoteright}s fold and its function and also provides a path to custom proteins for bioengineering applications. Impressive strides have been made in the design of soluble proteins, but designing membrane proteins remains a challenge. Joh et al. achieve a milestone by designing a transmembrane Zn2+ transporter (see the Perspective by Lupas). The protein comprises four helices: Two tightly interacting pairs form a weaker interface that facilitates the transport of Zn2+ with concomitant reverse transport of protons.

    abstract = {This lab experiment uses 31P NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules to determine pKa values and the binding energies of metal/biomolecule complexes. Solutions of adenosine nucleotides are prepared, and a series of 31P NMR spectra are collected as a function of pH and in the absence and presence of magnesium or calcium ions. The chemical shifts in the spectrum change depending on the protonation state of the phosphate groups and the nucleotide/metal interaction. Because 31P NMR spectroscopy is used, the resulting data are clean and readily accessible for student analysis. The use of 31P NMR spectroscopy presents a rich opportunity to deepen student engagement with NMR spectroscopy and spectral analysis. Furthermore, the inclusion of biomolecules and metal binding exposes students to important and underrepresented concepts that bridge organic chemistry and biochemistry. Students will learn how to prepare, collect, and analyze non-hydrogen samples using NMR spectroscopy, identify an unknown pKa, and calculate binding energies for a metal complex. This experiment is suitable for students in a second-year undergraduate organic chemistry course and could also be used in an analytical chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, or an advanced instrumentations laboratory course.}
