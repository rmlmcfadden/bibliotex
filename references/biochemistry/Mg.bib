   abstract = "In this article, we review the structural chemistry of the alkali and alkaline earth metal cations (Mg2+, Na+, and K+) with three classes of biological macromolecule (proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids). Emphasis is placed on crystallographically well-characterized examples that illustrate the characteristic features of ligand type and coordination geometry that define the binding specificity and functional role (structural or catalytic) of these co-factors. Reflecting the availability of literature data, the focus of the review is directed toward magnesium chemistry. Four classes of magnesium coordination site (A-D) are defined according to whether the co-factor interacts predominantly with the protein or substrate, and serves either a structural or catalytic role. The distinction between inner and outer coordination modes is made. There is an apparent tendency for magnesium to bind to nucleic acids by extensive hydrogen bonding from waters of hydration to heteroatoms on bases and the ribose-phosphate backbone, while inner-sphere binding to proteins is promoted by the well-defined chelating pockets defined by protein residues. With regard to the functional role of the metal, the lability of these metal cofactors must be considered in the context of enzyme mechanism, inasmuch as the most stable structural configuration is not necessarily the competent coordination state for enzyme turnover. Oxygen ligation (from carboxylates, hydroxyl, water, or phosphate functionality) is common, although coordination by N-7 of guanosine is frequently observed in metal nucleotide structures in the solid state. In contrast to calcium-binding proteins, no general binding motifs have been clearly identified for magnesium sites in proteins."

   abstract = "Magnesium is essential for biochemical functions of cells. Since Mg2+ has a relatively low ionic radius in proportion to the size of the nucleus (0.86 versus 1.14 f A for Ca2+), itshows exceptional biochemical activity. Due to its physicochemical properties, intracellular magnesium can bind to the nucleus, ribosomes, cell membranes or macromolecules occurring in the cell’s cytosol. It is indispensable for the nucleus to function as a whole and for the maintenance of physical stability as well as aggregation of rybosomes into polysomes able to initiate protein synthesis. Mg2+ can also act as a cofactor for ribonucleic acid enzymes (ribozymes) capable of specifically recognizing and cleaving the target mRNA. As an essential cofactor in NER, BER, MMR processes, Mg2+ is required for the removal of DNA damage. An activator of over 300 different enzymes, magnesium participates in many metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, β-oxidation or ion transport across cell membranes. Mg2+ plays a key role in the regulation of functions of mitochondria, including the control of their volume, composition of ions and ATP production.",

    abstract = {Abstract Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are actually salts (or complexes) of metal ions from a chemical point of view. It is impossible to separate the behavior of DNA and RNA from their interactions with metal ions. Metal ions are usually required to promote and stabilize functionally active or native conformations of nucleic acids, as well as to mediate nucleic acid-protein interactions. However, certain metal ions can also cause structural transformation of nucleic acids, and induce their chemical modification and cleavage. Metal-nucleic acid interactions are involved in nucleotide biochemistry; genetic information storage and transfer, and control of gene expression, as well as in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. However, in most cases, it is not currently clear whether the observed effects actually result from direct metal ion-nucleic acid interaction, since other species, such as specific proteins, may be mediators between the metal ion and the nucleic acid in these processes in vivo. Interest in metal-nucleic acid interactions is also enhanced by studies of the mechanisms of antitumor activity of certain platinum metal compounds, finding metal ions in crystal structure of natural RNA molecules, studies of the mechanism of RNA catalysis and possible involvement of metal ions in origin of life, as well as by the use of metal ions as structural probes of nucleic acids and as biotechnology tools. This article does not attempt to be comprehensive, but rather presents selected examples to illustrate key facets of metal ion-nucleic acid interaction. The focus is on the chemical and structural properties of both nucleic acids and metal ions relevant to their interactions. Nucleic acid-metal interactions can be either nonspecific or dependent on the chemical nature, sequence, and structure of nucleic acids. However, the specificity of these interactions is dependent on structural and chemical properties of both the nucleic acids and the metal ions. Both nucleic acids and metal ions exhibit considerable complexity in their interactions, and such interactions could affect the chemical and biochemical properties of both species.}
