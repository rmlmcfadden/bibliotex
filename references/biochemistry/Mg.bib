   abstract = "In this article, we review the structural chemistry of the alkali and alkaline earth metal cations (Mg2+, Na+, and K+) with three classes of biological macromolecule (proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids). Emphasis is placed on crystallographically well-characterized examples that illustrate the characteristic features of ligand type and coordination geometry that define the binding specificity and functional role (structural or catalytic) of these co-factors. Reflecting the availability of literature data, the focus of the review is directed toward magnesium chemistry. Four classes of magnesium coordination site (A-D) are defined according to whether the co-factor interacts predominantly with the protein or substrate, and serves either a structural or catalytic role. The distinction between inner and outer coordination modes is made. There is an apparent tendency for magnesium to bind to nucleic acids by extensive hydrogen bonding from waters of hydration to heteroatoms on bases and the ribose-phosphate backbone, while inner-sphere binding to proteins is promoted by the well-defined chelating pockets defined by protein residues. With regard to the functional role of the metal, the lability of these metal cofactors must be considered in the context of enzyme mechanism, inasmuch as the most stable structural configuration is not necessarily the competent coordination state for enzyme turnover. Oxygen ligation (from carboxylates, hydroxyl, water, or phosphate functionality) is common, although coordination by N-7 of guanosine is frequently observed in metal nucleotide structures in the solid state. In contrast to calcium-binding proteins, no general binding motifs have been clearly identified for magnesium sites in proteins."

   abstract = "Magnesium is essential for biochemical functions of cells. Since Mg2+ has a relatively low ionic radius in proportion to the size of the nucleus (0.86 versus 1.14 f A for Ca2+), itshows exceptional biochemical activity. Due to its physicochemical properties, intracellular magnesium can bind to the nucleus, ribosomes, cell membranes or macromolecules occurring in the cell’s cytosol. It is indispensable for the nucleus to function as a whole and for the maintenance of physical stability as well as aggregation of rybosomes into polysomes able to initiate protein synthesis. Mg2+ can also act as a cofactor for ribonucleic acid enzymes (ribozymes) capable of specifically recognizing and cleaving the target mRNA. As an essential cofactor in NER, BER, MMR processes, Mg2+ is required for the removal of DNA damage. An activator of over 300 different enzymes, magnesium participates in many metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, β-oxidation or ion transport across cell membranes. Mg2+ plays a key role in the regulation of functions of mitochondria, including the control of their volume, composition of ions and ATP production.",
