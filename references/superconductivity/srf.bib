    journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
    abstract = {The past five decades have seen many successes in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) enabling a variety of accelerators. These successes are the result of steady progress in understanding the science behind the performance limitations, and in developing effective countermeasures to advance key performance aspects. SRF technology has developed in parallel to bring major accelerators to reality for a wide variety of fields from high energy physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear astro-physics to materials science.}

    abstract = { Part I of this article provides a status update on the ongoing projects for both high-beta and low-beta applications. Some of these projects are already under production, others are perfecting prototypes and future plans. We first cover the funded projects and continue with the planned projects. The update naturally captures the state-of-the-art for superconducting RF (SRF) performance for applications in progress. Part II goes on to present a vision for future prospects for performance progress in the field, along with some advice about the likely fruitful R\&D paths to follow. In general, the R\&D paths chosen for discussion will benefit most SRF-based accelerators. }
