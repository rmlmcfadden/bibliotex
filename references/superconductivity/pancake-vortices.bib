	% abstract = {The spin-lattice relaxation rate (both for nuclei and paramagnetic centres) is calculated with due account for the fluctuating magnetic fields created by the vortex lattice in layered superconductors. Assuming that the oscillations of the two-dimensional vortex segments (“pancakes”) are not correlated, the analytical expressions are obtained for the dependences of the relaxation rate on temperature and magnetic field. The results allow us to explain some peculiarities of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation, previously observed on Tl-based HTSC and organic superconductors k-(BEDT-TTF)2X.}

Arrays of such vortices have been used to model the magnetic structure in highly anisotropic layered cuprate high-temperature superconductors. I show how the electromagnetic forces between pancake vortices can be calculatated, and I briefly discuss the effects of interlayer Josephson coupling.",
