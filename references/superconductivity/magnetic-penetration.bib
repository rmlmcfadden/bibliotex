	abstract = {The effect of smooth inhomogeneities near a superconductor boundary on the magnetic penetration depth λ is studied with emphasis on the proximity-induced spatial dependence of the Cooper pair amplitude. The influence of surface pair breaking or pair formation on λ is described within the Ginzburg–Landau theory, with no model assumptions, for both strongly type-II and strongly type-I homogeneous superconductors. Generic values of λ, which can differ greatly from the London penetration depth, are identified and demonstrated to be induced by large-scale inhomogeneities, when superconductivity is strongly suppressed on the surface.}
