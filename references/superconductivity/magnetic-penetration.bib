This equation takes into account spatial variation of the magnetic penetration depth. The magnetic flux penetration into an inhomogeneous superconducting slab is calculated and a method is described whereby the spatial variation of the critical temperature can be obtained from an inductiveTctransition. The consequences of using other sample geometries and the relevance of this work to the characterization of practical superconducting wires is discussed.",

	journal = {J. Phys.: Condens. Matter},
	abstract = {The effect of smooth inhomogeneities near a superconductor boundary on the magnetic penetration depth λ is studied with emphasis on the proximity-induced spatial dependence of the Cooper pair amplitude. The influence of surface pair breaking or pair formation on λ is described within the Ginzburg–Landau theory, with no model assumptions, for both strongly type-II and strongly type-I homogeneous superconductors. Generic values of λ, which can differ greatly from the London penetration depth, are identified and demonstrated to be induced by large-scale inhomogeneities, when superconductivity is strongly suppressed on the surface.}
