	abstract = "Eilenberger's quasiclassical equations are solved numerically, for the first time without approximations, for a hexagonal vortex lattice. The numerical methods used in this computation are described in detail. Particular emphasis is laid on the thermodynamics of low-$\kappa$, type II superconductors, where a first-order transition at the lower critical fieldHc1 occurs (type II/1 behavior). The phase boundary separating type II/1 from type II behavior is computed and compared with the predictions of the asymptotic theory. Besides the thermodynamic properties, the microscopic structure of the order parameter and magnetic field is discussed in detail. On the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz cell the magnetic field shows a new stationary point (saddle point). It should be possible to test this prediction by $\mu$SR experiments.",

	abstract = "The magnetic vortices in superconductors usually repel each other. Several cases are discussed when the vortex interaction has an attractive tail, and thus a minimum, leading to vortex clusters and chains. Decoration pictures then typically look like in the intermediate state of type-I superconductors, showing lamellae or islands of Meissner state or surrounded by Meissner state, but with the normal regions filled with Abrikosov vortices that are typical for type-II superconductors in the mixed state. Such intermediate-mixed state was observed and investigated in detail in pure Nb, TaN and other materials 40 years ago; last year it was possibly also observed in MgB2, where it was called ``a totally new state'' and ascribed to the existence of two superconducting electron bands, one of type-I and one of type-II. The complicated electronic structure of MgB2 and its consequences for superconductivity and vortices are discussed. It is shown that for the real superconductor MgB2 which possesses a single transition temperature, the assumption of two independent order parameters with separate penetration depths and separate coherence lengths is unphysical.",

Until now a comprehensive theory for such configurations has not been presented. We solve this old-standing fundamental problem by developing an approach which combines the perturbation expansion of the microscopic theory with statistical simulations and which requires no prior assumption on the vortex distribution. Our study offers the most complete picture of the interchange of the superconductivity types available so far. The mixed state in this regime reveals a rich manifold of exotic configurations, which reproduce available experimental results. Our work introduces a pattern formation mechanism that originates from the self-duality of the theory that is universal and not sensitive to the microscopic details.",

We report the robust self-organisation of the vortex lattice domains to elongated parallel stripes perpendicular to the applied current in a steady-state. The experimental results for the formation of the superstructure are supported by theoretical calculations, which highlight important details of the vortex matter evolution. The investigation demonstrates a mechanism of a spontaneous pattern formation that is closely related to the universal physics governing the IMS in low-κ superconductors.}

In this case, when the system is initially in type I, it can change its magnetic response, crossing the intertype domain with $\kappa$ ∼ 1 between the two standard superconductivity types and arriving at type II. In the present work we demonstrate that the impact of disorder can be much more profound in the presence of the multiband structure of the charge carrier states. In particular, when the band diffusivities differ from each other, the intertype domain tends to expand significantly, including points with $\kappa$ ≫ 1 that belong to deep type-II in conventional single-band superconductors. Our finding sheds light on the nontrivial disorder effect and significantly complements earlier results on the enlargement of the intertype domain in clean multiband superconductors.",
