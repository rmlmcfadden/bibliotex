	% abstract = "We report the observation of strong electron-phonon coupling in intergranular linked BiIn superconductors over an infinite range mediated by low-lying phonons. An enhanced superconducting transition temperature was observed from the magnetization, revealing a main diamagnetic Meissner state below TC(0){\thinspace}={\thinspace}5.86(1) K and a critical field HC(0){\thinspace}={\thinspace}1355(15) Oe with an In2Bi phase of the composite sample. The electron-phonon coupling to low lying phonons is found to be the leading mechanism for observed strong-coupling superconductivity in the BiIn system. Our findings suggest that In2Bi is in the strong-coupling region with TC(0){\thinspace}={\thinspace}5.62(1) K, $\lambda$ep{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1.45, $\omega$ln{\thinspace}={\thinspace}45.92{\thinspace}K and $\alpha${\thinspace}={\thinspace}2.23. The estimated upper critical field can be well-described by a power law with $\alpha$ value higher than 2, consistent with the strong electron-phonon coupling.",
