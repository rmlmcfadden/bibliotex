	% abstract = {Non-invasive magnetic field sensing using optically-detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond was used to study spatial distribution of the magnetic induction upon penetration and expulsion of weak magnetic fields in several representative superconductors. Vector magnetic fields were measured on the surface of conventional, elemental Pb and Nb, and compound LuNi2B2C and unconventional iron-based superconductors Ba1−x KxFe2As2 (x = 0.34 optimal hole doping), Ba(Fe1−x Cox)2As2 (x = 0.07 optimal electron doping), and stoichiometric CaKFe4As4, using variable-temperature confocal system with diffraction-limited spatial resolution. Magnetic induction profiles across the crystal edges were measured in zero-field-cooled and field-cooled conditions. While all superconductors show nearly perfect screening of magnetic fields applied after cooling to temperatures well below the superconducting transition, Tc, a range of very different behaviors was observed for Meissner expulsion upon cooling in static magnetic field from above Tc. Substantial conventional Meissner expulsion is found in LuNi2B2C, paramagnetic Meissner effect is found in Nb, and virtually no expulsion is observed in iron-based superconductors. In all cases, good correlation with macroscopic measurements of total magnetic moment is found.}

	% ABSTRACT = {The experimental data in the literature concerning the Paramagnetic Meissner Effect (PME) or also called Wohlleben effect are reviewed with the emphasis on the PME exhibited by metallic, s-wave superconductors. The PME was observed in field-cool cooling (FC-C) and field-cool warming (FC-W) m(T)-measurements on Al, Nb, Pb, Ta, in compounds such as, e.g., NbSe2, In-Sn, ZrB12, and others, and also in MgB2, the metallic superconductor with the highest transition temperature. Furthermore, samples with different shapes such as crystals, polycrystals, thin films, bi- and multilayers, nanocomposites, nanowires, mesoscopic objects, and porous materials exhibited the PME. The characteristic features of the PME, found mainly in Nb disks, such as the characteristic temperatures T1 and Tp and the apparative details of the various magnetic measurement techniques applied to observe the PME, are discussed. We also show that PME can be observed with the magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface, that PME can be removed by abrading the sample surface, and that PME can be introduced or enhanced by irradiation processes. The PME can be observed as well in magnetization loops (MHLs, m(H)) in a narrow temperature window Tp&lt;Tc, which enables the construction of a phase diagram for a superconducting sample exhibiting the PME. We found that the Nb disks still exhibit the PME after more than 20 years, and we present the efforts of magnetic imaging techniques (scanning SQUID microscopy, magneto-optics, diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-center magnetometry, and low-energy muon spin spectroscopy, (LE-&mu;SR)). Various attempts to explain PME behavior are discussed in detail. In particular, magnetic measurements of mesoscopic Al disks brought out important details employing the models of a giant vortex state and flux compression. Thus, we consider these approaches and demagnetization effects as the base to understand the formation of the paramagnetic signals in most of the materials investigated. New developments and novel directions for further experimental and theoretical analysis are also outlined.},
