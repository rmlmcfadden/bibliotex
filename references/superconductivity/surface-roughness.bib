	abstract = {It is well known that within the London model, the magnetic field near the surface of a superconductor in the Meissner state decays exponentially as a function of depth. However, direct measurements of the magnetic field profile using low energy μSR find that the decayis non-exponential on a length scale much smaller than λ. It has been suggested this is due to surface roughness. In this paper we examine the effect of surface roughness theoretically. Through asymptotic and numerical analysis, we model the effects of surface roughness on the magnetic field profile for a superconductor with a two-dimensional sinusoidal variation in the surface boundary. The calculated field profiles are indeed non-exponential and with some unexpected behaviour. The model results show consistency with experimental results, indicating that surface roughness could explain the experimental anomalies.}

	abstract = "One of the defining characteristics of a superconductor is the Meissner effect, in which an external magnetic field is expelled from the bulk of a sample when cooled below the critical temperature. Although there has been considerable theoretical work on the Ginzburg--Landau theory of superconductors, the effects of interest in this paper can be modelled with the simpler London equation. This equation predicts an exponential decay of the local magnetic field magnitude as a function of the distance into the superconductor from a flat surface in the London limit where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}kappa ={\backslash}lambda /{\backslash}xi {\$}{\$}, defined as the ratio between the penetration depth and coherence length, is much greater than 1. However, recent measurements of the field profile in high {\$}{\$}{\backslash}kappa {\$}{\$}superconductors show that the observed decay is non-exponential near the surface. In particular, the measured field profiles indicate that the decay rate in the field magnitude is smaller than expected from a simple London model on a short length scale {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}near the surface. In this paper, we examine the effects of surface roughness on magnetic field penetration into a high {\$}{\$}{\backslash}kappa {\$}{\$}superconductor. We model the roughness as a sinusoidal perturbation from a flat interface and investigate the effect using both an asymptotic method, based upon a small-amplitude perturbation, and a numerical method, using a finite difference discretization with a coordinate mapping from an underlying rectangular domain. A novel discretization is used in the case of 3D calculations and a fast, preconditioned GMRES solver is developed. A careful comparison of asymptotic and numerical methods validates both approaches for small perturbations, but the numerical approach allows for the investigation of rougher surfaces. Our results show that surface roughness reduces the decay rate in the average magnetic field near the surface relative to a London model. However, the reduction is more gradual than the simple dead layer model currently being used to fit experimental data. In addition, we discover some interesting new phenomena in the 3D case.",

	abstract = "It is well known that the London model (valid for a hard type II superconductor) predicts an externally applied magnetic field decays exponentially as a function of depth into the superconductor on a length scale $\lambda$. Direct measurements of the field profile using low energy $\mu$SR on high-Tc superconductors, such as YBa2Cu3Oxmeasure deviations from a simple exponential decay. In particular, there is a short length scale $\delta$ close to the surface where the magnetic field does not decay. It has been proposed that this is due to surface roughness, which leads to a suppression of the order parameter near the surface. A model of surface roughness has been studied for the case of a sinusoidally modulated surface roughness on an isotropic superconductor showing that in some cases the profiles resulting from surface roughness may be qualitatively similar to the dead layer phenomena in that the field magnitude decay rate may be slowed near the surface relative to a flat interface but that for modest roughness, the quantitative value of the length over which the field decay is slowed is much smaller than the experiments measure. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: firstly, by using atomic force microscopy data of YBa2Cu3Oxcrystals, we predict the expected field profiles within the context of the Isotropic London model of superconductivity given their actual surface geometry; and secondly, we consider how surface roughness could affect experimental values for $\lambda$ and $\delta$. The main finding is that roughness within an isotropic model does not produce the dead layers found in experiments on YBa2Cu3Ox. However, we suggest that roughness in a highly anisotropic superconductor could account for the observed dead layer.",
