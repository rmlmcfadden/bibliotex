	abstract = {The use of superconducting resonators for a proton linear accelerator is shown to reduce greatly the radio-frequency power requirements and, in principle, to make a c.w. high intensity machine practicable. Rough estimates of costs do not preclude the proposal on economic grounds. Some of the technical problems involved are also discussed.}
