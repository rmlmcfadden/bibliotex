	abstract     = {{The \betaNMR (\beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance) facility at TRIUMF offers the possibility of depth-resolved probing of the Meissner state over the first §I{100}{\nano\meter} below a sample surface. The measurement can give the attenuation of the applied magnetic field, as a function of depth. The technique can be especially important when probing layered systems like the dirty/clean S-S (superconductor-superconductor) bi-layer and S-I-S (Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor) structures. The TRIUMF SRF (Superconducting RF) group has recently completed first measurements at beta-NMR on Nb samples with various treatments. The results and method will be reported.}},
