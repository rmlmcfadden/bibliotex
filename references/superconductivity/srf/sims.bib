	% abstract = {Accurate secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurement of nitrogen in niobium relies on the use of closely equivalent standards, made by ion implantation, to convert nitrogen signal intensity to nitrogen content by determination of relative sensitivity factors (RSFs). Accurate RSF values for ppm-range nitrogen contents are increasingly critical, as more precision is sought in processes for next-generation superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerator cavities. Factors influencing RSF value measurements were investigated with the aim of reliably attaining better than 10\\% accuracy in nitrogen concentrations at various depths into the bulk. This has been accomplished for materials typical of SRF cavities at the cost of increased attention to all aspects.},

	% abstract = "{The importance of SIMS analyses for “N-doped” impurity alloyed niobium and other surface-alloyed materials continues to increase. A major hurdle is the uncertainty of instrument calibration due to changes in sample height either from sample surface topography or from the sample holder itself. The CAMECA sample holder design allows for many types of samples to be analyzed. However, a drawback is that the holder faceplate can bend, contributing an uncertainty in the relative sensitivity factor (RSF) used to quantify the SIMS results. Here, we describe an improved sample holder having a reinforced faceplate, which prevents deflection and reduces uncertainty. Simulations show that the new design significantly reduces deflection from 10 μm to 5 nm. Sample measurements show a reduction of RSF uncertainty from this source from 4.1\\% to 0.95\\%. Grain orientation has long been suspected to affect RSF measurement as well. A bicrystal implant standard, consisting of randomly oriented and [001] grains, was successively rotated 15° between analyses. It was observed that 20\\% of the analyses performed on the randomly oriented grain exhibited anomalously high RSF values as well as slow sputter rates. These features were associated with the changing grain normal orientation with respect to the primary Cs+ beam. The grain orientation associated with the rise in RSF was simulated and determined to be the [101] crystallographic plane, thus indicating that ion channeling was responsible for the significantly increased RSF. Focused ion beam analysis confirmed slower sputter rates for the cardinal crystallographic orientations, indicating that ion channeling occurred for each.}",

	% abstract = "{Detection of surface contamination on niobium materials used in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) applications is difficult due to quantitative sensitivity and near-atomic depth resolution needed. Inspection of samples known to have experienced surface contamination was found to have inconsistent nitride coverage after high-temperature nitrogen gas exposure (“doping”). We compare contaminating species found on samples treated in several different vacuum furnaces, both “exposed” directly in the chamber and “protected” by containment shielding from evaporative sources with “furnace caps.” Typically, furnace caps are used to impede contamination from reaching the interior surface of cavities during the high-temperature vacuum bake that immediately precedes exposure to nitrogen gas. Although, to date, little is known about the effectiveness of these caps, SIMS results showed that they were effective in limiting contamination arising from the furnace environment. Inspection of sample surfaces by SEM showed a lack of nitrides present on contaminated specimens. TEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy performed on these samples revealed that a carbon-rich layer now existed, indicating that a relatively high contaminant load prevents the nucleation and growth of surface nitrides, while thus inhibiting interstitial nitrogen uptake. Except in extreme cases, subsequent removal of the top several micrometers of the surface via electropolishing appears to effectively eliminate any strong influence on the subsequent SRF cavity performance. With the absence of furnace cleaning, carbon contamination was found to be nearly 10× higher for protected nitrogen-doped and electropolished samples, with minimal metallic contamination detected for both processes. SIMS analysis was also performed to compare the cleanliness of samples fully prepared by such nitrogen “doping” with those prepared by a related process, involving the dissolution of niobium surface oxide and diffusion of oxygen into the surface. This oxygen doping or alloying process offers attractive advantages.}",
