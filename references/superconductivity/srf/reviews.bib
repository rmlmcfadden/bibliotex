	title = {Superconducting {RF} materials other than bulk niobium: a review},
	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	abstract = {For the past five decades, bulk niobium (Nb) has been the material of choice for superconducting RF (SRF) cavity applications. Alternatives such as Nb thin films and other higher-Tc materials, mainly Nb compounds and A15 compounds, have been investigated with moderate effort in the past. In recent years, RF cavity performance has approached the theoretical limit for bulk Nb. For further improvement of RF cavity performance for future accelerator projects, research interest is renewed towards alternatives to bulk Nb. Institutions around the world are now investing renewed efforts in the investigation of Nb thin films and superconductors with higher transition temperature Tc for application to SRF cavities. This paper gives an overview of the results obtained so far and challenges encountered for Nb films as well as other materials, such as Nb compounds, A15 compounds, MgB2, and oxypnictides, for SRF cavity applications. An interesting alternative using a superconductor–insulator–superconductor multilayer approach has been recently proposed to delay the vortex penetration in Nb surfaces. This could potentially lead to further improvement in RF cavities performance using the benefit of the higher critical field Hc of higher-Tc superconductors without being limited with their lower Hc1.}

	title = {Theory of {RF} superconductivity for resonant cavities},
	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	abstract = {An overview of a theory of electromagnetic response of superconductors in strong radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields is given with the emphasis on applications to superconducting resonant cavities for particle accelerators. The paper addresses fundamentals of the BCS surface resistance, the effect of subgap states and trapped vortices on the residual surface resistance at low RF fields, and a nonlinear surface resistance at strong fields, particularly the effect of the RF field suppression of the surface resistance. These issues are essential for the understanding of the field dependence of high quality factors achieved on the Nb cavities at 1.3–2 K in strong RF fields Ba close to the depairing limit, and the extended rise which has been observed on Ti and N-treated Nb cavities. Possible ways of further increase of and the breakdown field by optimizing impurity concentration at the surface and by multilayer nanostructuring with materials other than Nb are discussed.}

    abstract = {The past five decades have seen many successes in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) enabling a variety of accelerators. These successes are the result of steady progress in understanding the science behind the performance limitations, and in developing effective countermeasures to advance key performance aspects. SRF technology has developed in parallel to bring major accelerators to reality for a wide variety of fields from high energy physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear astro-physics to materials science.}

    abstract = { Part I of this article provides a status update on the ongoing projects for both high-beta and low-beta applications. Some of these projects are already under production, others are perfecting prototypes and future plans. We first cover the funded projects and continue with the planned projects. The update naturally captures the state-of-the-art for superconducting RF (SRF) performance for applications in progress. Part II goes on to present a vision for future prospects for performance progress in the field, along with some advice about the likely fruitful R\&D paths to follow. In general, the R\&D paths chosen for discussion will benefit most SRF-based accelerators. }
