	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	abstract = {The surface resistance Rs of superconducting materials can be obtained by measuring the quality factor of an elliptical cavity excited in a transverse magnetic mode (TM010). The value obtained has however to be taken as averaged over the whole surface. A more convenient way to obtain Rs, especially of materials which are not yet technologically ready for cavity production, is to measure small samples instead. These can be easily manufactured at low cost, duplicated and placed in film deposition and surface analytical tools. A commonly used design for a device to measure Rs consists of a cylindrical cavity excited in a transverse electric (TE110) mode with the sample under test serving as one replaceable endplate. Such a cavity has two drawbacks. For reasonably small samples the resonant frequency will be larger than frequencies of interest concerning SRF application and it requires a reference sample of known Rs. In this article we review several devices which have been designed to overcome these limitations, reaching sub-nΩ resolution in some cases. Some of these devices also comprise a parameter space in frequency and temperature which is inaccessible to standard cavity tests, making them ideal tools to test theoretical surface resistance models.}

For several cavities an increasing surface resistance above a threshold field, saturating at higher field has been observed. Measurements on samples give evidence that this effect is caused by the surface electric field. The measured temperature and frequency dependence is consistent with a model that accounts for these losses by interface tunnel exchange between localized states in dielectric oxides and the adjacent superconductor.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of generating superconducting coatings on niobium using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is demonstrated. A silicate-phosphate electrolyte was employed containing MgB2 particles. The coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The coatings contained crystalline Nb2O5, SiO2-rich amorphous material, and incorporated MgB2. The magnetic moment-temperature curve determined using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer revealed a transition to the superconducting state at 39 K, characteristic of MgB2. The increasing negative magnetic moment of MgB2 below 39 K is proposed to be due to differences in the critical fields of individual MgB2 clusters.}

The incorporation of MgB2 into the coating was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The additions of particles to the electrolyte promoted a voltage decrease, possibly a result of the initiation of a “soft” sparking regime. The transition occurred at earlier times with increase of the MgB2 concentration and enhanced MgB2 incorporation into the coating. The coating containing particles was thicker than one in which MgB2 was absent and had a nodular surface, with MgB2 accumulations in the valleys between the nodules. A superconducting quantum interference device revealed superconductivity below about 39 K, the critical temperature of MgB2, and hysteresis in magnetic moment-field curves that typifies a type II superconductor.}

From preliminary experiments, a suitable PEO condition was selected. The coatings were examined by analytical scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Superconductivity was assessed using magnetic moment-field measurements. At 6 K, superconductivity of the niobium dominated, which revealed strong flux pinning and sudden release. The latter was more gradual following PEO, indicating pinning was a surface effect. Between the critical temperature of niobium (9.25 K) and MgB2 (about 39 K), the diamagnetic behaviour of superconducting MgB2 was present, with earlier flux penetration the closer the temperature to 39 K. The hysteresis loop indicated stronger flux pinning for lower temperatures, as expected for a superconductor.",

	abstract = {A combination of X-ray computed tomography (CT) and focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has been employed to investigate substrate and related surface defects in a niobium coated superconducting radio frequency (SRF) copper cavity. The cavity was manufactured by spinning, with subsequent application of a sputtering-deposited niobium coating (≈40 μm thick) on the internal surface. Before coating, the copper surface was pre-treated in several stages, ending with chemical polishing. CT and FIB-SEM identified furrow defects (≈20 μm deep) in the copper beneath the coating, which originated from the spinning process. The furrows were filled with niobium and contained voids at the Nb/Cu interface that extended a few microns into the niobium coating. The presence of the defects led to similar furrows at the niobium surface. The study revealed the importance of pre-treatment of the cavity internal surface and control of the spinning process to avoid defects that may have deleterious influence on the Q slope and durability of the niobium coating.}

	ABSTRACT = {Reducing the size of ambient magnetic flux trapping during cooldown in superconducting radio-frequency niobium cavities is essential to reaching the lowest power dissipation as required for continuous wave application. Here, it is suggested that applying an alternating magnetic field superimposed to the external DC field can potentially reduce the size of trapped flux by supporting flux line movement. This hypothesis is tested for the first time systematically on a buffered chemically polished (BCP) niobium sample before and after high temperature annealing, a procedure which is known to reduce flux pinning. External low-frequency (Hz-range) magnetic fields were applied to the samples during their superconducting transition and the effect of varying their amplitude, frequency and offset was investigated. A few results can be highlighted: The influence of the frequency and magnitude of the AC fields on the flux trapping in the untreated Nb sample cannot be neglected. The trapped flux seems to be homogeneously distributed, unlike the flux trapping in, e.g., lead (Pb), which is a type I superconductor. After annealing, the Nb sample shows practically no dependency of flux trapping on external AC fields. The trapped magnetic flux was measured by polarized neutron imaging, and calculations of trapped fields show good agreement with experimental results.},

	abstract = {The maximum accelerating gradient of superconducting radio frequency cavities are currently reaching their theoretical limits, due to the magnetic field entering the superconductor in the form of vortices. To overcome these limits, thin film coated superconducting materials are required, however these need to be tested to optimise their properties. A system has been designed, built, and commissioned at Daresbury Laboratory that applies a local DC magnetic field parallel to the surface, from one side of a sample, similar to that in cavity operation. A magnetic flux density (up to 600 mT) is generated parallel to the sample surface in the 2 mm gap of a C-shaped ferrite yoke. Two Hall probe sensors are used to measure both the applied and penetrated magnetic field. The system operates in a cryogen free environment, with a minimum temperature of approximately 2.6 K. A Pb foil has been used to characterise the system, and determine how the sample size affects the results. Nb thin film samples have been tested for varying thickness to determine how the depth effects the field of full flux penetration, . The design, operation, methods of analysis and first results of this facility will be reported in this paper.}
