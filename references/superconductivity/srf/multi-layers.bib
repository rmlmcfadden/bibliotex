The procedure shown in this note would be useful to evaluate BML based on properties of one’s own films.}

We investigate of semi-infinite superconductors and layered structures in the diffusive limit using the well-established quasiclassical Green’s function formalism of the BCS theory. The coupled Maxwell–Usadel equations are self-consistently solved to obtain the spatial distributions of the magnetic field, screening current density, penetration depth, pair potential, and . For a semi-infinite superconductor in the diffusive limit, we obtain at the temperature . Here, is the thermodynamic critical-field at the zero temperature. By laminating a superconducting film (S) with the thickness on a semi-infinite superconductor (Σ), we can engineer of the layered structure. When is the optimum thickness , can be larger than that of the simple semi-infinite superconductors made from the S and Σ materials: . The present study addresses the calculation of of the dirty heterostructure using the microscopic theory from beginning to end for the first time, which contributes to the microscopic understanding of the surface engineering for pushing up the accelerating gradient of superconducting cavities for particle accelerators.}

In heterostructures composed of different superconductors, the current in each layer depends not only on the properties of the individual material, but also on the electromagnetic response of the adjacent layers through boundary conditions at the interfaces.
