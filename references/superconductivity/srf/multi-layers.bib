	abstract = {We revisit the field limit of a superconductor–insulator–superconductor multilayer structure for particle accelerator cavities (BML), taking into account thickness (d)-dependent critical temperature, normal resistivity, and normal density of states seen in many thin films. Resultant d-dependent thermodynamic critical field and penetration depth lead to the appearance of a peak in BML(d) which has been missed in the previous studies. The procedure shown in this note would be useful to evaluate BML based on properties of one’s own films.}
