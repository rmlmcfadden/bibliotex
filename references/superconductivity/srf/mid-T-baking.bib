	abstract = "The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities depends on the condition of the niobium surface. Recently, various heat treatment methods have been investigated to achieve an unprecedentedly high quality factor (Q) and high accelerating field (E). We report the influence of a new baking process called furnace baking on the Q–E behavior of 1.3 GHz SRF cavities. Furnace baking is performed as the final step of the cavity surface treatment; the cavities are heated in a vacuum furnace for 3 h, followed by high-pressure rinsing and radio-frequency measurement. This method is simpler and potentially more reliable than previously reported heat treatment methods, and it is therefore easier to apply to the SRF cavities. We find that the quality factor is increased after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 300 \\$^\\circ\\$C to 400 \\$^\\circ\\$C, while a strong decrease in the quality factor at for a high accelerating field is observed after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 600 \\$^\\circ\\$C to 800 \\$^\\circ\\$C. We find significant differences in the surface resistance for various processing temperatures.",

	% ABSTRACT = {Mid-T heat treatments in the range from 250°C to 400°C on superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities have been shown to provide high quality factors that rise with applied rf field strength in high frequency, electro-polished (EP), elliptical cavities operating at 2 K, similar to nitrogen doped cavities. The rise in quality factor is attributed to a decrease in the temperature dependent part of the surface resistance R<sub>BCS</sub>. Until now, no results have been reported for these new treatments on quarter-wave resonators (QWR) and half-wave resonators (HWR). The TRIUMF multi-mode coaxial cavities are dedicated test cavities that allow frequency and temperature resolved performance characterization of treatments without changing environments, therefore providing an excellent test vehicle to test these new treatments with rf frequencies ranging from 200 to 1,200 MHz. In this paper, performance measurements from both QWR and HWR cavities are reported and their performance compared with four different treatments: baseline, a conventional 120°C low temperature bake for 48 h, and two mid-T bakes at 300°C and 400°C for 3 h. In addition, sample analysis using SEM, EDX and SIMS of witness samples is also shown. It is found that the mid-T bakes are not directly transferable to low frequency cavities. In the fundamental modes of the two test cavities, no performance gain over the baseline treatment nor a decreasing temperature dependent component with rising rf amplitude was observed. At frequencies above 1 GHz and low temperatures, the mid-T bakes show a reduced field dependence of R<sub>BCS</sub> compared to both the baseline and 120°C treatments.},

Lett. 89, 022507 (2006)] to sequential overlayer dissolutions, multilayer dissolution, and realistic temperature profiles, which may be applicable to other materials. The model is applied to secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profile measurements for varying temperature profiles and two-step oxide dissolution in Nb and found to agree well. In the context of the Meissner screening response due to impurity profiles on the length scale of the London penetration depth, the shallow diffusion of O impurities results in a substantial decrease in the peak supercurrent density near the surface. In this framework, oxide dissolution and oxygen diffusion can account for a rise in peak supportable magnetic field in SRF cavities with baking time and a suppression after the optimal baking time is reached, in good agreement with peak-field baking temperatures and times as well as recent quench field measurements.},

	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	% abstract = {In order to determine optimal parameters of vacuum thermal processing of superconducting radiofrequency niobium cavities exhaustive information on the initial chemical state of niobium and its modification upon a vacuum heat treatment is required. In the present work the chemical composition of the niobium surface upon ultra-high vacuum baking at 200 ∘C–400 ∘C similar to ‘medium-temperature baking’ and ‘furnace baking’ of cavities is explored in-situ by synchrotron x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our findings imply that below the critical thickness of the  layer () niobium starts to interact actively with surface impurities, such as carbon and phosphorus. By studying the kinetics of the native oxide reduction, the activation energy and the rate-constant relation have been determined and used for the calculation of the oxygen-concentration depth profiles. It has been established that the controlled diffusion of oxygen is realized at temperatures 200 ∘C–300 ∘C, and the native-oxide layer represents an oxygen source, while at 400 ∘C the pentoxide is completely reduced and the doping level is determined by an ambient oxygen partial pressure. Fluorine (F to Nb atomic ratio is 0.2) after the buffered chemical polishing was found to be incorporated into the surface layer probed by XPS (), and its concentration increased during the low-temperature baking (F/Nb = 0.35 at 230 ∘C) and depleted at higher temperatures (F/Nb = 0.11 at 400 ∘C). Thus, the influence of fluorine on the performance of mid-T baked, nitrogen-doped and particularly mild-baked (120 ∘C/48 h) cavities must be considered. The possible role of fluorine in the educed  reaction under the impact of an x-ray beam at room temperature and during the thermal treatment is also discussed. The range of temperature and duration parameters of the thermal treatment at which the niobium surface would not be contaminated with impurities is determined.}

	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	% abstract = {Medium-temperature baking (Mid-T baking) is an innovative method employed to enhance the unloaded quality factor Q0 of superconducting radio-frequency niobium (SRF Nb) cavities at cryogenic temperatures. This study presents an interstitial oxygen diffusion model based on the decomposition of the natural oxide to clarify the improved performance of the Nb cavities after undergoing Mid-T baking. Additionally, the correlation between the interstitial oxygen within the RF penetration depth and the surface resistance of the Nb cavities has been explored. The parameter for the oxide decomposition was determined using in-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the thickness of the oxide/carbide layer was calculated from the peak fitting of Nb 3d spectra and the attenuation law of the photoelectron beam. The interstitial oxygen diffusion model, validated by the semi-quantitative distribution along the depth determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, quantifies the oxygen atomic concentration within the RF penetration depth in Mid-T baked Nb material. In the baking temperature range of 300 °C–400 °C, the calculated oxygen concentration from the interstitial oxygen diffusion model demonstrates a more pronounced dependence on the baking temperature than the baking time. This suggests that more precise control of the interstitial oxygen concentration can be achieved by adjusting the baking temperature. Furthermore, it has been observed that maintaining a uniform and moderate oxygen concentration throughout the depth is essential for optimal Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer resistance. This study paves the way for more efficient processing optimization and enhancing understanding of the mechanism behind RF loss in Nb cavities.}

	abstract={Vacuum thermal treatments (baking) are known to improve the superconducting properties of the RF surface layer of niobium cavities, and are employed as a last processing step to increase their efficiency determined by intrinsic quality factor Q$_0$. A specific method to perform the baking has been used. It consists in annealing of an evacuated cavity with the local heaters installed on its outer surface in a cryostat which ensures an exterior vacuum and protects the outer cavity surface from oxidation. Such a set-up has a number of advantages as it does not require to cool the cavity flanges during baking, and allows to perform the "cold" RF characterization of the cavity \textit{in situ}, immediately after the thermal treatment without disassembly of heating elements. Moreover, the air exposure that causes partial degradation of Q$_0$ by surface reoxidation is avoided. The heat treatment of a single-cell \SI{1.3}{\giga\hertz} niobium cavity at \SI{230}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{24}{\hour} demonstrated the doubling of Q$_0$ at $E_{acc}$=\SI{10}{\mega\volt\per\meter} (from \SI{1.20e10}{} to \SI{2.4e10}{}) and retained the maximal accelerating field of \SI{35}{\mega\volt\per\meter} without quenching. The selection of treatment parameters is based on our previous XPS studies. This treatment ensures incomplete dissolution of the native oxide by oxygen diffusion, thereby preventing interaction of niobium surface with external contaminants. We propose to bake the cavities directly in a cryomodule, which would allow to use the treatment to improve their performance. The potential impact of material parameters on the components of surface resistance has been briefly examined.}
