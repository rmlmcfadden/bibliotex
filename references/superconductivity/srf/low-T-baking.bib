	abstract = "A recently discovered modified low-temperature baking leads to reduced surface losses and an increase of the accelerating gradient of superconducting TESLA shape cavities. We will show that the dynamics of vacancy-hydrogen complexes at low-temperature baking lead to a suppression of lossy nanohydrides at 2{\thinspace}K and thus a significant enhancement of accelerator performance. Utilizing Doppler broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy, Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy and instrumented nanoindentation, samples made from European XFEL niobium sheets were investigated. We studied the evolution of vacancies in bulk samples and in the sub-surface region and their interaction with hydrogen at different temperature levels during in-situ and ex-situ annealing.",

	abstract = "Superconducting Radio-Frequency cavities are currently made out of niobium. Niobium cavities are limited by the magnetic field on the cavity walls due to the entry of vortices at the field of first vortex penetration, H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}vp{\}}{\$}{\$}. Low temperature baking in vacuum or low pressure gas atmosphere removes the strong decrease of the quality factor with accelerating gradient (high field Q-slope). Some cavities reach surface magnetic field above the lower critical field H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}c1{\}}{\$}{\$}. One hypothesis for this performance increase is that the outer layer affected by the treatments acts as a barrier for vortex penetration (effective bilayer). Using a vibrating sample magnetometer the field of first flux penetration (H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}vp{\}}{\$}{\$}) was measured for Nb ellipsoids with various low temperature treatments. All H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}vp{\}}{\$}{\$}values were found to be consistent with the lower critical field, H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}c1{\}}{\$}{\$}, as predicted for clean niobium. This led to the conclusion that a metastable flux free state above H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}c1{\}}{\$}{\$}cannot be observed in DC magnetometry for low temperature baked niobium unlike for bilayers consisting of two superconductors as previously published. The effect of flux pinning differed significantly between treatments, suggesting that the high field Q-slope mitigation might be related to vortex pinning in the surface of the cavities.",
