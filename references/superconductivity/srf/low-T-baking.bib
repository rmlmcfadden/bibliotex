The samples were treated by electropolishing and low temperature baking (120° C, 48 h). While the residual resistivity ratio changed by a factor of ∼3 among the samples, no significant variation was found in their superconducting properties. The onset field for flux penetration at 2 K, Hffp, measured within a ∼30 μm depth from the surface, was ∼160 mT, close to the bulk value. The baking effect was mainly to increase the field range up to which a coherent superconducting phase persists on the surface, above the upper critical field.}",

	abstract = {We present the results from DC magnetization and penetration depth measurements of cylindrical bulk large-grain (LG) and fine-grain (FG) niobium samples used for the fabrication of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. The surface treatment consisted of electropolishing and low-temperature baking as they are typically applied to SRF cavities. The magnetization data are analyzed using a modified critical state model. The critical current density Jc and pinning force Fp are calculated from the magnetization data and their temperature dependence and field dependence are presented. The LG samples have lower critical current density and pinning force density compared to FG samples, favorable to lower flux trapping efficiency. This effect may explain the lower values of residual resistance often observed in LG cavities than FG cavities.}

Such cavities suffer from the anomalous field dependence of their quality factors Q0. High field degradation—so-called ‘high field Q-slope’—is so far unexplained even though an empirical cure is known. Here, we propose a mechanism based on the presence of proximity-coupled niobium hydrides that can explain this effect. Furthermore, the same mechanism can be present in any surface-sensitive experiments or superconducting devices involving niobium.}

Niobium cavities are limited by the magnetic field on the cavity walls due to the entry of vortices at the field of first vortex penetration, H{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}vp{\}}{\$}{\$}. Low temperature baking in vacuum or low pressure gas atmosphere removes the strong decrease of the quality factor with accelerating gradient (high field Q-slope).

One hypothesis for this performance increase is that the outer layer affected by the treatments acts as a barrier for vortex penetration (effective bilayer).

The temperature and duration of baking control the onset of the high field Q-slope and overall quality factor over the baseline measurements. The increase in quality factor is generally related to the reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance, which refers to BCS surface resistance due to the reduction in the electronic mean free path and elimination of high field Q-slope is still being actively investigated. Here, we present the results of a series of measurements on 1.3 GHz TESLA shape single-cell cavities with successive low-temperature baking at 120 $^{\circ}$C up to 96 h. The rf loss related to the trapping of residual magnetic field refers to flux trapping sensitivity measured with respect to the duration of 120 $^{\circ}$C bake.},
