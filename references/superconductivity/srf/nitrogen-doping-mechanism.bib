	% abstract = {The condensation and desorption kinetics of H2 and N2 on polycrystalline wires of Ta and Nb are examined for solute concentrations between 0.1 and 100 monolayers. Accurate comparisons of adsorbate densities and sticking coefficients on Ta, Nb, Mo and W are obtained by making simultaneous measurements on all four substrates in the same vacuum system. Desorption exhibits second order kinetics for all substrates at all coverages. Desorption activation energies are higher on Ta and Nb than on W and Mo for both gases. Diffusion limited desorption is observed for H2 at high heating rates. Solution of H2 occurs at measurable rates (s ≳ 0.01) in Ta and Nb even at 78 °K while for N2 no solution is observed for T < 600 °K.}

	% abstract = {The reaction between nitrogen and bulk niobium under high purity conditions was studied in the range 1100–1900 °C at 150 kPa. Two different nitride layers are formed: an inner β phase (Nb2N) and an outer δ phase (NbN). The latter undergoes a transformation to γ-NbN and ϵ-NbN during cooling down. Nitrogen dissolves in the niobium core forming α solid solution. Both the weight gain and the thickness of the nitride layers follow the parabolic rate law, indicating that the reaction is mainly dominated by diffusional transport through the nitrides. Two parabolic kinetic stages are observed, the first before α phase saturation and the second after saturation. Data analysis based on a multiphase, moving boundary diffusion model allows the calculation of the effective nitrogen diffusion coefficients, yielding the expressions Dβ = 1.11[±0.5] exp(−3.23[±0.4] × 105/RT) cm2 s−1 and Dδ = 3.27[±1.5] exp(−3.19[±0.25] × 105/RT) cm2 s−1.}

The surface treatments of the Nb samples consisted of heavy electropolishing (EP), nitrogen doping and the subsequent EP with different amounts of material removal. The critical fields and the superconducting parameters were calculated from the magnetization data and their dependence on the subsequent EP material removal was presented. Unexpected pinning behavior of the N-doped Nb samples with subsequent EP material removal was observed and the Nb hydrides were suspected to be the possible contributor to the unexpected pinning effects of the N-doped Nb samples. Direct observation of Nb hydrides precipitation on both the N-doped and the un-doped Nb samples has been carried out using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with a cold stand at 80 K, providing direct evidence of the NH interaction that the amounts of Nb hydrides precipitation on the N-doped samples can be reduced to varying degrees with different amounts of material removal. Based on the study of magnetic properties and Nb hydrides precipitation observation, a possible physical image of NH interaction affecting the magnetic properties of the N-doped Nb samples was proposed. The effects of subsequent EP material removal dependence of magnetic properties and Nb hydrides precipitation reveal the important role of NH interaction in the understanding of the physical mechanism of nitrogen doping phenomenon.}

This model incorporates variations in the sticking coefficient of nitrogen during the adsorption process on the Nb surface, along with the impact of nitride formation resulting from the reaction between Nb and nitrogen. The conclusions drawn from this model are compared with the outcomes of vertical test experiments. The computed results indicate that exhibiting a significant nitrogen doping effect is achieved when the nitrogen concentration is approximately 1E25 atom/m3 under various nitrogen doping recipes. This study enhances the understanding of the nitrogen doping process and enables the rapid determination of the optimal subsequent material removal thickness for various experimental recipes.}
