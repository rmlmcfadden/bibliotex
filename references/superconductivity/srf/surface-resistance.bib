	% abstract = {This Brief Note investigates the relationship between the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and the maximum achievable surface magnetic field in superconducting bulk niobium (Nb) cavities. Data spanning the 1980s to the 2020s, with RRR values ranging from 30 to 500, are compared with theoretical performance limits, including the lower critical field (Bc1), the superheating field (Bsh), and the thermal runaway field (Brun). The analysis reveals that modern Nb cavities are approaching Brun and the metastability region above Bc1 across the entire RRR spectrum, but they remain well below the fundamental limit set by Bsh. Achieving Bsh requires not only a defect-free surface but also ensuring that Brun exceeds Bsh. The latter condition, often overlooked, is not always met at 2 K.}
