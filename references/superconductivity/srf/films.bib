	% abstract = {A systematic study of superconducting properties of niobium films sputtered on the inner wall of radiofrequency cavities is presented. The measured quantities include in particular the response to 1.5 GHz microwaves, the critical temperature, the penetration depth and the magnetic penetration field. In addition to films grown in different gas discharges (Xe, Kr, Ar and Ar/Ne mixtures) and to films grown on substrates prepared under different conditions, the study also includes bulk niobium cavities. The surface resistance is analysed in terms of its dependence on temperature, on RF field and, when relevant, on the density of trapped fluxons. A simple parameterisation is found to give a good fit to the data. Once allowance for the presence of impurities and defects is made by means of a single parameter, the electron mean free path, good agreement with BCS theory is observed. The fluxon-induced losses are studied in detail and their dependence on RF field, on temperature and on the density of trapped fluxons is analysed. The residual resistance is observed to be essentially uncorrelated with the other variables, suggesting that it is dominantly extragranular. In occasions very low residual resistances, in the nÎ© range, have been maintained over a broad range of RF field, indicating the absence of significant fundamental limitations specific to the film technology in practical applications such as the production of accelerating cavities for particle accelerators.}
