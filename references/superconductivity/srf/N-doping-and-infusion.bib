	abstract = {We report a surface treatment that systematically improves the quality factor of niobium radio frequency cavities beyond the expected limit for niobium. A combination of annealing in a partial pressure of nitrogen or argon gas and subsequent electropolishing of the niobium cavity surface leads to unprecedented low values of the microwave surface resistance, and an improvement in the efficiency of the accelerating structures up to a factor of 3, reducing the cryogenic load of superconducting cavities for both pulsed and continuous duty cycles. The field dependence of the surface resistance is reversed compared to standardly treated niobium.}

	abstract = {The Q-factor of superconducting accelerating cavities can be substantially improved by a special heat treatment under N2 atmosphere (N-doping). Recent experiments at Fermi National Laboratory investigated the dependence of Q on the RF frequency and showed, unexpectedly, both an increase and a decrease with the RF field amplitude. This paper shall explain this finding by extending a previously proposed model founded on the two fluid model of RF losses, percolation, and the proximity effect in a disordered composite.},

	abstract = {Advances in SRF technology over the last 40 years allowed achieving accelerating gradients ~50 ​MV/m corresponding to peak surface magnetic fields close to the theoretical limit of niobium. However, the quality factor decreases significantly with increasing accelerating gradient. This decrease is expected since increasing the rf field increases the number of quasiparticles and therefore the rf losses. Recently, a new phenomenon of increase in quality factor with an accelerating gradient has been observed when SRF cavities are doped with certain non-magnetic impurities. In particular, the diffusion of nitrogen into the niobium cavities’ inner surface has been successfully implemented into the commercialization of SRF technology. The quest is still ongoing towards process development to achieve high accelerating gradient SRF structures with high-quality factors for future high energy accelerators. Here, we present the review of the research on process development to this date via nitrogen diffusion, material analysis, and present the summary of current theoretical understanding behind high Q0 SRF cavities.}
