	% abstract = {We present the results for the resonant frequency shift and quality factor of disordered niobium (Nb) superconducting radio-frequency cavities driven out of equilibrium by the resonant microwave field. The theory is based on the non-equilibrium theory of superconductivity for the current response to the electromagnetic field at the vacuum–metal interface. We are able to accurately predict the observed frequency shifts with a precision of order fractions of kHz over the full temperature range 0 < T ≤ T<sub>c</sub>, including the negative frequency shift anomalies that are observed very near T<sub>c</sub>. The origin of these anomalies is shown to be the competition between the normal metal skin depth and the London penetration depth, which diverges as <mml:math id="m1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math>. An analytical approximation to the full current response, valid for |T − T<sub>c</sub>|≪ T<sub>c</sub>, accounts for the negative frequency shift near T<sub>c</sub>. The non-monotonic dependence of the quality factor on the quasiparticle scattering rate is related to the pair-breaking effect of disorder on the superfluid fraction and, thus, the London penetration depth.}
