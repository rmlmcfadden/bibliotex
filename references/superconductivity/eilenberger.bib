	abstract = "The stationary behavior of type II superconductors is completely described by Gorkov's equations for a set of four Green's functions, supplemented by two self-consistency equations for gap parameter$\Delta$(r) and vector potentialA(r). Expanding all quantities as usual at the Fermi surface and averaging over impurity positions, this set of equations is transformed into a simpler set for integrated Green's functions (which still contain much more information than is needed in most cases). The resulting equations, when linearized, yield essentially L{\"u}ders' transport equation for de Gennes' correlation function. The full equations contain all the known results and provide a promising starting point for numerical calculations.",
