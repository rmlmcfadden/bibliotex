The interaction between vortices is attractive for all those type-II superconductors in which field reversal occurs, but field reversal is not a cause of attractive interaction. On the other hand, oscillatory behavior of magnetic fields contributes to attractive interaction. The critical values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, below which attractive interaction occurs, satisfy essentially the equation Re ($\Lambda$−1)=$\xi$0−1.",

Let $\lambda$ and $\xi$ be the decay lengths determining the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic field and the order parameter for an isolated vortex. Then the onset of attraction in the limit of large vortex separation is either given by $\lambda$=$\xi$ or by $\lambda$ becoming complex, whichever occurs first. It is shown that in general a first order transition atHc1 takes place already in the region of asymptotic repulsion because of the appearance of a minimum in the interaction energy at finite vortex separation.",

	abstract = {In order to study the nature of phase transitions along the magnetization curve of low-κ superconductors, several Ta-, Nb- and V- single crystals of varying impurity content and, hence, different Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ (Tc) were investigated. The results are compared with recent microscopic calculations valid at arbitrary impurity content, but restricted to the weak-coupling isotropic limit. For the type-I/type-II/1 phase boundary, the differences between theory and experiment are attributed to anisotropy effects. On the type-II side of the phase diagram, theory predicts a significant dependence of the phase boundary on the impurity concentration, whereas the experiments fall on a rather uniform boundary curve.}
