	% abstract = {Absolute values of the penetration depth λ of a magnetic field into a superconductor at different temperatures can be obtained from the relative values indicated by measurements on colloids, if Δλ, the difference between λ at a variable and at a fixed temperature, is known. Various methods of measuring Δλ are briefly reviewed, and a detailed account is given of one particular method in which Δλ is deduced from the changes of susceptibility of thin cylinders with temperature. The changes found for mercury cylinders were, within experimental error, inversely proportional to the radii as simple theory demands, and the temperature variation was consistent with that to be expected from the colloid results. The absolute value of λ at 0° K. is estimated as 7.6 × 10-6 cm. In the case of tin the values of Δλ measured by the present method were in rough agreement with those of other methods, but since no colloid results were available, the absolute value of λ remains undetermined. The mercury results are discussed also in relation to critical field measurements on thin films. Some preliminary results bearing on the possible dependence of λ on magnetic field are mentioned; it is concluded that λ does not vary appreciably in fields up to half the critical value.}

	% abstract="Motivated by a well established body of theoretical work on the nonlinear Meissner state electrodynamics of type II superconductors, we have developed a high sensitivity ac susceptometer to measure the magnetic field dependence of the penetration depth $\lambda$ in single crystal YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$₋$\delta$. The susceptometer is capable of measuring changes in the penetration depth in typical sized crystals to within a few tenths of an Angstrom. This represents a significant increase in the resolution of such a device, and offers increased functionality over superconducting microwave resonators in its ability to measure $\Delta$$\lambda$ as a function of field as well as temperature. In addition, we have developed appropriate procedures to ensure that our field dependent measurements remained free of unwanted magnetic flux penetration into the sample, and that subsequent results represented the intrinsic nonlinear Meissner response of the sample. This has allowed us to test present ideas about the nature of high temperature superconductivity through an accurate comparison of $\Delta$$\lambda$(H) measurements with theory. In particular, the theory predicts that a d-wave superconductor will exhibit a field dependent penetration depth that is linear in field near T = 0 and crosses over to a weak quadratic field dependence with increased temperature. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect should depend on the direction of the applied field with an anisotropy that reflects the symmetry of both the superconducting order parameter and the crystal structure. Measurements presented in this thesis were made on three high quality single crystals of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$₋$\delta$. In all cases, the field dependence of the penetration depth could not be described in full by the theory of the Nonlinear Meissner Effect. The anisotropy seen in $\Delta$$\lambda$(H) may be a result of the orthorhombic crystal structure and the strong anisotropy in the zero temperature, in-plane penetration depth $\lambda$a,b(0), and as such may be consistent with theory. However, theory also predicts a strong suppression of $\Delta$$\lambda$(H) with increasing temperature, in stark constast to the measurements which show a small increase. We believe the dx{\texttwosuperior}-y{\texttwosuperior} symmetry of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$₋$\delta$ to be well established by other experiments, and do not think that our results represent evidence contrary to this fact. Rather, it is our contention that present theories of the Nonlinear Meissner Effect simply do not describe in full the nonlinear behaviour of the penetration depth in a d-wave superconductor. Our results are also compared with a very recent idea of a field induced gap suppression in a d-wave superconductor; this theory showed some success in its ability to correctly predict the direction in which $\Delta$$\lambda$(H) evolves with temperature. We also show that there is evidence for a possible c-axis contribution to $\Delta$$\lambda$(H). Overall, at present there appears to be no single theory that can explain the field dependence of the penetration depth measured here for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$₋$\delta$.",

	abstract = "The discovery of the Meissner (Meissner--Ochsenfeld) effect in 1933 was an incontestable turning point in the history of superconductivity. First, it demonstrated that superconductivity is an unknown before equilibrium state of matter, thus allowing to use the power of thermodynamics for its study. This provided a justification for the two-fluid model of Gorter and Casimir, a seminal thermodynamic theory founded on a postulate of zero entropy of the superconducting (S) component of conduction electrons. Second, the Meissner effect demonstrated that, apart from zero electric resistivity, the S phase is also characterized by zero magnetic induction. The latter property is used as a basic postulate in the theory of F. and H. London, which underlies the understanding of electromagnetic properties of superconductors. Here the experimental and theoretical aspects of the Meissner effect are reviewed. The reader will see that, in spite of almost nine decades age, the London theory still contains questions, the answers to which can lead to a revision of the standard picture of the Meissner state (MS) and, if so, of other equilibrium superconducting states. An attempt is made to take a fresh look at electrodynamics of the MS and try to work out with the issues associated with the description of this most important state of all superconductors. It is shown that the concept of Cooper's pairing along with the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition allows one to construct a semi-classical theoretical model consistently addressing properties of the MS and beyond, including non-equilibrium properties of superconductors caused by the total current. As follows from the model, the three ``big zeros'' of superconductivity (zero resistance, zero induction and zero entropy) have equal weight and grow from a single root: quantization of the angular momentum of paired electrons. The model predicts some yet unknown effects. If confirmed, they can help in studies of microscopic properties of all superconductors. Preliminary experimental results suggesting the need to revise the standard picture of the MS are presented.",

This non-linear Meissner effect is an equally important manifestation of the nodal state as the well studied linear-in-T dependence of $\lambda$, but has never been convincingly experimentally observed. Here we present measurements of the nodal superconductors CeCoIn5 and LaFePO which clearly show this non-linear Meissner effect. We further show how the effect of a small dc magnetic field on $\lambda$(T) can be used to distinguish gap nodes from non-nodal deep gap minima. Our measurements of KFe2As2 suggest that this material has such a non-nodal state.",
