	% abstract = {Inhomogeneities in superconducting Nb have considerable influence on ac losses in cables; they also give bad rf results. To study inhomogeneities near Nb surfaces, the magnetic induction profile B (x) and hence the critical current density jc(x) were determined as a function of distance x from the surface in samples which were machined, annealed, and chemically polished or electro‐polished and anodized. With identical samples the magnetization and 18‐kHz penetration depths were also measured as a function of dc magnetic field, applied parallel to the surface. These measurements on Nb samples, which were all exposed to air, indicate that two superconducting phases exist near the surface. One of them has an Hc2 much higher (50\%) and the other somewhat higher (10\%) than Hc2 in the bulk. In addition, strong pinning exists near the surface as evidenced by jc higher than 106 A/cm2. These effects were found, although to a somewhat lesser extent, even after UHV annealing. The high Hc2 values and strong pinning near the surface, even above the bulk Hc2, can be explained by the presence of inhomogeneities there.},

	abstract = { The dependence of the volume pinning force on different paths taken to arrive at a state (B, T) is investigated for a variety of type II superconductors having widely different reversible and irreversible parameters, by measuring the local induction with an a.e. technique. Line pinning and a distorted flux line lattice are properties of those samples which show history dependence. Using a model of Kramer (1973) it is deduced that the history effect is caused by a dependence of the shear modulus on the defect structure of the flux line lattice. The effect occurs at relatively low reduced magnetic fields. It is also observed in materials with high values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k and large volume pinning forces. }

	% abstract = {Known expressions, for the critical temperature, critical field and pinning force in NbTi are combined into a self-consistent fit formula that provides the critical current density as a function of temperature and field. The main advantage of such a fit is the extended validity range. Data available in literature and measurements on LHC strands are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the fit. The J/sub c/ data-sets used to cover a range of field from 0 T to 9 T and temperature from 1.9 K to 9 K. The standard deviation of the fits presented is of the order of 5% or better. This accuracy is generally sufficient for design purposes, extrapolation and scaling of measured results. Better accuracy, e.g. for short sample limit prediction, can be achieved restricting the domain of validity.},
