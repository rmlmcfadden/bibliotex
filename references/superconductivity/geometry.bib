	abstract = {The magnetic response of type-II superconductors can be irreversible due to two different reasons: vortex pinning and barriers for flux penetration. Even without bulk pinning and in the absence of a microscopic Beanâ€“Lingston surface barrier for vortex penetration, superconductors of non-ellipsoidal shape can exhibit a large geometric barrier for flux penetration. This edge barrier and the resulting irreversible magnetization loops and flux-density profiles are computed from continuum electrodynamics for superconductor strips and disks with constant thickness, both with and without bulk pinning. Expressions for the field of first flux entry Hen and for the reversibility field Hrev above which the pin-free magnetization becomes reversible, are given. Both fields are proportional to the lower critical field Hc1 and depend only on the specimen shape. These realistic results are compared with the reversible magnetic behavior of ideal superconductor ellipsoids.}
