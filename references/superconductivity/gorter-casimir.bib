	abstract = {In this paper we give a phenomenological treatment of supracon-ductivity based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and on the assumption that the magnetic induction inside a supraconductive body is zero. After a brief survey of new experiments on supraconductivity (§ 1) these ideas are applied to a body, which is entirely in the supraconductive state (§ 2). In § 3 we consider the transition process for a needle parallel to a magnetic field and derive an equation connecting the jump of the specific heat and the derivative of the magnetic threshold value with respect to the temperature (Rutgers' equation). In § 4 these considerations are extended to a more general system of supraconductive bodies; in this case there will be a continuous transition process. In § 5 the disturbance of supraconductivity of a cylinder by a current flowing in the cylinder is considered in detail and Silsbee's hypothesis is confirmed. In § 6 we discuss our results and the experimental evidence for our fundamental assumptions. Some questions, which remain as yet unsolved, are mentioned.}
