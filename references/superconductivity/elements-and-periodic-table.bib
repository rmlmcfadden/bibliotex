	% abstract = {This chapter describes the occurrence of superconductivity among the elements. It indicate features that through the discovery and study of a large number of superconducting compounds and alloys, have been found to be common to all superconductors, elements, compounds and alloys alike. This, however, was done by an oversimplification that went so far as to consider only properties of the single atom, and to take the averages in the case of composite systems. The occurrence of superconductivity again follows the rules that are discussed in the chapter. The valence electron per atom concentration, favorable to superconductivity, again varies between two and eight for all alloys. Transition temperatures also follow qualitatively the electron concentration in the manner outlined for the elements in figure provided in the chapter. There are slight shifts of the peaks for different crystal symmetries. While here volume exponents between five and ten can be found seven is the dominant one.}

Recent advances in the instrumentation of physics under pressure have enabled the observation of superconductivity in many elements not previously known to superconduct, and at steadily increasing temperatures. This article offers a review of the state of the art in the superconductivity of elements, highlighting underlying correlations and general trends.}
