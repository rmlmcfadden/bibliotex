	abstract = {We report on a systematic investigation of the superconductivity in vanadium and its impurity dependence. Starting from a high-purity single crystal (Γ = 1200) we find that no changes of the Fermi surface seem to occur for resistivity ratios ≥ 450. On the contrary, the second anisotropy coefficient a6 is still sensitive to variations of the impurity parameter in this range indicating contributions of an anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The overall Hc2-anisotropy is larger than in Nb and still significant at an impurity parameter α = 2.81. The attractive flux line interaction is found to be comparable with the results reported for Nb.}

	abstract = {The influence of structural defects on superconducting properties of pure Ta was studied by the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), magnetic and electrical resistivity measurements. The obtained results provide a clear evidence that the type-I superconductivity in Ta may be converted into type-II by introducing structural defects. In particular, PALS spectra measured for Ta samples indicate that two cold-rolled samples contain a high concentration of defects (mainly dislocations and vacancies associated with them). At the same time, the annealed sample is almost free of any defects. Magnetic results show that both cold-rolled samples exhibit type-II superconductivity while after annealing the Ta sample recovers type-I superconductivity. The estimated Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ from the electrical resistivity data reveals that the annealed Ta sample is the type-I superconductor with κ=0.69(1) which is slightly less value than the critical value of κc=1/2. At the same time, both cold-rolled samples are type-II superconductors with κ≈κc.}
