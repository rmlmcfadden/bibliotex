	abstract = {From magnetization measurements in superconducting Nb and Nb-rich Nb-Ta alloys, it was found that the discrepancies between experiment and theory in the upper critical field and two Ginzburg-Landau parameters as a function of temperature in pure Nb are directly related to the anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap, and not to its non-weak coupling nature. Besides the above-mentioned conclusion, several electronic parameters were deduced from the measurements. The temperature coefficient of the electronic specific heat, γ, as a function of Ta concentration has a peak at several atomic per cent of Ta, whereas the superconducting transition temperature drops very rapidly from 9.23°K for pure Nb as Ta is added. An estimation of the carrier concentration in Nb showed that all carriers in the normal state probably go into the superconducting state at sufficiently low temperatures.}

On the low-$\kappa$ side of the magnetic phase diagram, where at some low temperature 0 <T* <Tca transition from type I to type II superconductivity occurs, a new effect has been observed, as reported briefly elsewhere: because of the correlation ofHc2 with crystal directions, at fixed temperatures nearT*, whether the sample is a type I or a type II superconductor depends on which crystal direction is oriented parallel to the external field. In the type II superconducting range all samples display anHc2 anisotropy effect, which is commonly observed in cubic superconductors, even in the extreme dirty limit ($\alpha${\~}12). However, the second anisotropy coefficient (l = 6 component) is found to be negligibly small in all tantalum samples.",

Starting from a high-purity single crystal (Γ = 1200) we find that no changes of the Fermi surface seem to occur for resistivity ratios ≥ 450. On the contrary, the second anisotropy coefficient a6 is still sensitive to variations of the impurity parameter in this range indicating contributions of an anisotropic electron-phonon coupling. The overall Hc2-anisotropy is larger than in Nb and still significant at an impurity parameter α = 2.81. The attractive flux line interaction is found to be comparable with the results reported for Nb.}

From experiments on a series of Ta, Nb, V and LaAl2 superconductors doped with varying amounts of impurity atoms, the phase boundaries between type-I superconductivity, type-II superconductivity with a first order phase transition at the lower critical field Hc1 and “normal” type-II superconductivity could be established experimentally and compared with theory. The analysis in terms of weak-coupling isotropic, strong-coupling isotropic and strong-coupling anisotropic theories demonstrates clearly that the location of the phase boundaries is determined primarily by anisotropy effects with only contributions of coupling corrections. The magnitude of the discontinuity at Hc1, on the other hand, is affected by both coupling and anisotropy effects in nearly the same way. In all cases, the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for temperatures near Tc is confirmed with high accuracy.}

	abstract = {The influence of structural defects on superconducting properties of pure Ta was studied by the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), magnetic and electrical resistivity measurements. The obtained results provide a clear evidence that the type-I superconductivity in Ta may be converted into type-II by introducing structural defects. In particular, PALS spectra measured for Ta samples indicate that two cold-rolled samples contain a high concentration of defects (mainly dislocations and vacancies associated with them). At the same time, the annealed sample is almost free of any defects. Magnetic results show that both cold-rolled samples exhibit type-II superconductivity while after annealing the Ta sample recovers type-I superconductivity. The estimated Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ from the electrical resistivity data reveals that the annealed Ta sample is the type-I superconductor with κ=0.69(1) which is slightly less value than the critical value of κc=1/2. At the same time, both cold-rolled samples are type-II superconductors with κ≈κc.}
