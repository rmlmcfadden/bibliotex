    abstract = "It is known that in superconductors the exponential decay of the magnetic field is an approximation, which breaks down if the dimension of a Cooper pair $\xi$fis of the order or smaller than the London penetration depth $\delta$. The appearance of a nonlocal relation between current and field yields deviations from the exponential decay especially a sign reversal of the field at a certain distance. This sign reversal is connected with a change: of the surface energy in superconductors and of the structure of fluxoids together with their interaction. In this paper we present results on the decay of magnetic field which is calculated from the exact BCS-integral-kernel for weak fields. As a result, the nonlocal effects in the framework of BCS-theory can be described in good approximation by the ratio of the London penetration depth $\delta$(T, l) and the dimension of Cooper pairs $\xi$f(T, l). The evaluations show, that one has still sign reversal, i.e. large nonlocal effects, in Type II superconductors with a $\kappa$(Tc)≲,1.6. It should be mentioned that the limit $\kappa$≲1.6 coincides roughly with the experimentally observed region of attraction of fluxoids. In addition results on the penetration depths are summarized.",

The results apply to classical superconductors as well as to unconventionally paired systems like the B-phase of superfluid 3He.",

In this paper, we will present measurements of the penetration depth in the Meissner state of both single crystal and polycrystalline samples of MgB2, using a very low field RF technique. λ(T) shows a clear exponential temperature dependence T/Tc≲0.2, strongly indicating that this material is fully gapped. Detailed fits to the superfluid density over the full temperature range of our measurements (1>T/Tc>0.04) gives strong support for the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, Δs=29 K and Δb=75 K, in agreement with recent theoretical predictions and other probes.}
