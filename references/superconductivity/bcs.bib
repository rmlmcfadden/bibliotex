    abstract = "It is known that in superconductors the exponential decay of the magnetic field is an approximation, which breaks down if the dimension of a Cooper pair $\xi$fis of the order or smaller than the London penetration depth $\delta$. The appearance of a nonlocal relation between current and field yields deviations from the exponential decay especially a sign reversal of the field at a certain distance. This sign reversal is connected with a change: of the surface energy in superconductors and of the structure of fluxoids together with their interaction. In this paper we present results on the decay of magnetic field which is calculated from the exact BCS-integral-kernel for weak fields. As a result, the nonlocal effects in the framework of BCS-theory can be described in good approximation by the ratio of the London penetration depth $\delta$(T, l) and the dimension of Cooper pairs $\xi$f(T, l). The evaluations show, that one has still sign reversal, i.e. large nonlocal effects, in Type II superconductors with a $\kappa$(Tc)≲,1.6. It should be mentioned that the limit $\kappa$≲1.6 coincides roughly with the experimentally observed region of attraction of fluxoids. In addition results on the penetration depths are summarized.",

In particular we derive interpolation formulae for the entropy, specific heat, and spin susceptibility of the normal component, formed by the thermal excitations (Bogoliubov quasiparticles), as well as for the superfluid density and hence the magnetic penetration depth, describing the response of the condensate. The results apply to classical superconductors as well as to unconventionally paired systems like the B-phase of superfluid 3He.",
