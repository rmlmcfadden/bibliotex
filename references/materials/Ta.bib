The Debye temperature was calculated from the elastic constants and found to have the value of 265 K at low temperature. The elastic constants become temperature independent at low temperatures and approach linear behavior at high temperatures.

The plateaus in the x (c) curve observed near H/Ta ratios of 12, 23 and 34 are attributed to stoichiometric compositions. The temperature dependence of χ is relatively weak. Phase transitions within the TaH system change the electronic susceptibility by approximately 1%, and may be observed clearly with a sensitive Faraday magnetometer. With the aid of differential thermal analysis results, the low temperature TaH phase diagram was established up to c = 0.8. The number of low temperature phases corresponds to the number of steps in the χ (c) measurements. This result indicates that for c ⩾ 0.5 the TaH phase diagram is determined mainly by the stoichiometry of the TaH bond.}
