   abstract = "Nuclear hyperfine interactions have been obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for 95Mo in a number of binary Mo compounds, both insulators and metals, which illustrate the interplay between nuclear quadrupole and chemical (Knight) shift terms. The insulating phases are characterised by nuclear spin lattice relaxation times greater than 100 s, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of indirect phonon Raman relaxation for these compounds."

   abstract = {We report on the first nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigation of inorganic fullerene-like MoS2 nanoparticles. Spectra of bulk 2H-MoS2 samples have also been measured for comparison. The similarity between the measured quadrupole coupling constants and chemical shielding anisotropy parameters for bulk and fullerene-like MoS2 reflects the nearly identical local crystalline environments of the Mo atoms in these two materials. EPR measurements show that fullerene-like MoS2 exhibits a larger density of dangling bonds carrying unpaired electrons, indicative of them having a more defective structure than the bulk sample. The latter observation explains the increase in the spin–lattice relaxation rate observed in the NMR measurements for this sample in comparison with the bulk 2H- MoS2 ones.}
