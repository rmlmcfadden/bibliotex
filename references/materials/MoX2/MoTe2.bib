The homogeneity region of the two phases lies between MoTe1.90 and MoTe1.99. The transition temperature is 820°C for Te-rich samples, and 880°C for Mo-rich samples. In order to avoid evaporation of Te, electrical resistivity measurements at high temperatures were carried out in a closed vessel, with the sample in equilibrium with its own vapour pressure. The properties of α- and β-MoTe2 are discussed in terms of a schematic energy level diagram."

The transition from the monoclinic room-temperature form is accompanied by a discontinuous change of the monoclinic angle β from 93°55′ to 90°, with substantial thermal hysteresis and coexistence of high- and low-temperature phases. The low-temperature structure is the result of a shear deformation of the layers perpendicular to the c axis.}

   abstract = {Abstract Domain configurations in the β-phase of MoTe2 are analysed by electron diffraction and imaging techniques, and related with the α → β phase transition. Structural models are proposed for the orientation variants giving rise to ortho-, meta-, and para-type boundaries, and for translation variants occurring in β-MoTe2. The expected fine structure of dislocations is analysed, and the interaction behaviour of dislocation ribbons upon boundary crossing is discussed. From electron diffraction experiments it is concluded that the most frequently occurring twin boundaries are of the para-type. Finally it is demonstrated by electron diffraction that the displacive β → β′ transition occurs in a continuous manner whereby the β-angle of the monoclinic structure decreases continuously to 90°.},

The group VIb ditellurides show deviation from a simple band model which predicts semiconducting behaviour due to a trigonal prismatic crystal-field splitting of a filled nonbonding dz2 orbital. For WTe2 and beta -MoTe2 the metal atom is displaced from the centre of an octahedron of Te atoms, and metal-metal chains with bond lengths only slightly longer than the elemental metals run along the layers. The reduced Madelung term for this configuration compensates for loss of the lone dz2-based band and thus results in semi-metallic crystals. Mo but not W occurs with a trigonal prismatic coordination ( beta -MoTe2). beta -MoTe2 differs from WTe2 only slightly-in the stacking of layers; a low-temperature polymorph is believed to stack identically to WTe2.}

   abstract = {A key issue in fabricating transistors is making a good electrical contact to the semiconductor gate material. For two-dimensional materials, one route is through a phase transition that converts a hexagonally packed semiconductor phase into a distorted octahedrally packed metallic phase. Cho et al. show that laser heating of molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) achieves this conversion through the creation of Te vacancies. The phase transition improves charge carrier mobility while maintaining the low resistance necessary for improved transistor function.Science, this issue p. 625Artificial van der Waals heterostructures with two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals are promising as an active channel or as a buffer contact layer for next-generation devices. However, genuine 2D heterostructure devices remain limited because of impurity-involved transfer process and metastable and inhomogeneous heterostructure formation. We used laser-induced phase patterning, a polymorph engineering, to fabricate an ohmic heterophase homojunction between semiconducting hexagonal (2H) and metallic monoclinic (1T{\textquoteright}) molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) that is stable up to 300{\textdegree}C and increases the carrier mobility of the MoTe2 transistor by a factor of about 50, while retaining a high on/off current ratio of 106. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy results combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the Te vacancy triggers the local phase transition in MoTe2, achieving a true 2D device with an ohmic contact.},

   abstract = {We synthesized distorted octahedral (T′) molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and investigated its vibrational properties with Raman spectroscopy, density functional theory, and symmetry analysis. Compared to results from the high-temperature centrosymmetric monoclinic (T′mo) phase, four new Raman bands emerge in the low-temperature orthorhombic (T′or) phase, which was recently predicted to be a type II Weyl semimetal. Crystal-angle-dependent, light-polarization-resolved measurements indicate that all the observed Raman peaks belong to two categories: those vibrating along the zigzag Mo atomic chain (z-modes) and those vibrating in the mirror plane (m-modes) perpendicular to the zigzag chain. Interestingly, the low-energy shear z-mode and shear m-mode, absent from the T′mo spectra, become activated when sample cooling induces a phase transition to the T′or crystal structure. We interpret this observation as a consequence of inversion-symmetry breaking, which is crucial for the existence of Weyl fermions in the layered crystal. Our temperature-dependent Raman measurements further show that both the high-energy m-mode at ∼130 cm–1 and the low-energy shear m-mode at ∼12 cm–1 provide useful gauges for monitoring the broken inversion symmetry in the crystal.}

   abstract = "In its orthorhombic Td polymorph, MoTe2 is a type-II Weyl semimetal, where the Weyl fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and hole pockets. Non-saturating magnetoresistance and superconductivity were also observed in Td-MoTe2. Understanding the superconductivity in Td-MoTe2, which was proposed to be topologically non-trivial, is of eminent interest. Here, we report high-pressure muon-spin rotation experiments probing the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth in Td-MoTe2. A substantial increase of the superfluid density and a linear scaling with the superconducting critical temperature Tc is observed under pressure. Moreover, the superconducting order parameter in Td-MoTe2 is determined to have 2-gap s-wave symmetry. We also exclude time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state with zero-field μSR experiments. Considering the strong suppression of Tc in MoTe2 by disorder, we suggest that topologically non-trivial s+− state is more likely to be realized in MoTe2 than the topologically trivial s++ state.",

   abstract = {Quasi{\textendash}two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit dramatic properties that may transform electronic and photonic devices. We report on how the anomalously large magnetoresistance (MR) observed under high magnetic field in MoTe2, a type II Weyl semimetal, can be reversibly controlled under tensile strain. The MR is enhanced by as much as ~30\% at low temperatures and high magnetic fields when uniaxial strain is applied along the a crystallographic direction and reduced by about the same amount when strain is applied along the b direction. We show that the large in-plane electric anisotropy is coupled with the structural transition from the 1T' monoclinic to the Td orthorhombic Weyl phase. A shift of the Td-1T' phase boundary is achieved by minimal tensile strain. The sensitivity of the MR to tensile strain suggests the possibility of a nontrivial spin-orbital texture of the electron and hole pockets in the vicinity of Weyl points. Our ab initio calculations show a significant orbital mixing on the Fermi surface, which is modified by the tensile strains.},
