	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	% abstract = {Significant efforts can be found throughout the literature to optimize the current-carrying capacity of Nb3Sn  superconducting wires. The achievable transport current density in wires depends on the A15 composition, morphology and strain state. The A15 sections in wires contain, due to compositional inhomogeneities resulting from solid-state diffusion A15 formation reactions, a distribution of superconducting properties. The A15 grain size can be different from wire to wire, and is also not necessarily homogeneous across the A15 regions. Strain is always present in composite wires, and the strain state changes as a result of thermal contraction differences and Lorentz forces in magnet systems. To optimize the transport properties, it is thus required to identify how composition, grain size and strain state influence the superconducting properties. This is not possible accurately in inhomogeneous and spatially complex systems such as wires. This article therefore gives an overview of the available literature on simplified, well-defined (quasi-)homogeneous laboratory samples. After more than 50 years of research on superconductivity in Nb3Sn, a significant amount of results are available, but these are scattered over a multitude of publications. Two reviews exist on the basic properties of A15 materials in general, but no specific review for Nb3Sn  is available. This article is intended to provide such an overview. It starts with a basic description of the niobium–tin intermetallic. After that, it maps the influence of Sn content on the electron–phonon interaction strength and on the field–temperature phase boundary. The literature on the influence of Cu, Ti and Ta additions will then be summarized briefly. This is followed by a review of the effects of grain size and strain. The article concludes with a summary of the main results.}

	journal = {Supercond. Sci. Technol.},
	% abstract = {A microns-thick film of Nb3Sn on the inner surface of a superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity has been demonstrated to substantially improve cryogenic efficiency compared to the standard niobium material, and its predicted superheating field is approximately twice as high. We review in detail the advantages of Nb3Sn coatings for SRF cavities. We describe the vapor diffusion process used to fabricate this material in the most successful experiments, and we compare the differences in the process used at different labs. We overview results of Nb3Sn SRF coatings, including CW and pulsed measurements of cavities as well as microscopic measurements. We discuss special considerations that must be practised when using Nb3Sn cavities in applications. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the state-of-the-art and describing the outlook for this alternative SRF material.}
