Coulombic, overlap repulsion and polarization energy terms were included in the potential energy expression. Preexponential factors in the overlap repulsion terms were evaluated by minimizing of the total electrostatic energy, and permanent dipole moments of the anion by an iterative method. The most favorable diffusion path was found to be parallel to the c-axis in the 12, 0, z direction in both TiO2 and MgF2. Motional activation enthalpies increased with increasing interstitial cation radius and were larger in TiO2 than in MgF2. The path was independent of radius and material. Strongly anisotropic conductivity was predicted for both compounds."

The diffusion coefficients are very sensitive to the electric charge of the impurity ions. Divalent impurities (e.g., Co and Ni) diffuse extremely rapidly in TiO2, compared to cation self-diffusion, and exhibit an extreme anisotropy in diffusion behavior, divalent-impurity diffusion parallel to the c-axis is much larger than it is perpendicular to the c-axis. Trivalent impurity ions (Sc and Cr) and tetravalent impurity ions (Zr) diffuse similar to cation self-diffusion, both as functions of temperature and oxygen partial pressure. The divalent impurity ions Co and Ni apparently diffuse as interstitial ions along open channels parallel to the c-axis. The results suggest that Sc, Cr and Zr ions diffuse by an interstitialcy mechanism involving the simultaneous and cooperative migration of tetravalent interstitial titanium ions and the tracer-impurity ions. Iron ions diffuse both as divalent and as trivalent ions. The impurity diffusion as functions of oxygen partial pressure and Al-impurity content are consistent with calculations of point-defect concentrations in rutile."

   abstract = { In recent years, TiO2, as a potential electrode material in Li and Na batteries, has been the subject of considerable experimental and computational research. However, the typical density functional theory (DFT) functionals used (e.g., the generalized gradient (GGA)) for such calculations are not without their shortcomings. To avoid these well-known issues, we report the first use of hybrid DFT calculations to calculate the Li and Na intercalation properties for anatase, rutile, and TiO2(B). The magnitude of GGA intercalation voltage underestimation is shown to vary depending on the polymorphs. We find that Li intercalation is most energetically preferred in anatase, while Na intercalation is most feasible for TiO2(B). Using the screened exchange hybrid functional, all intercalation processes are shown to be thermodynamically favorable, with the exception of Na in rutile. The electronic structures of these intercalated materials are also calculated, and significant improvements, in terms of band gap prediction and charge localization, are presented in comparison with GGA. We hope that our results will encourage more use of hybrid density functionals in the modeling of fundamental battery material properties.}

The crystals were characterised using both polarised optical microscopy and X-ray Laue techniques. The best quality crystals were prepared when neither the growing crystal nor the feed rod were rotated during crystal growth. When rotation was employed, this was found to introduce sub-grain boundaries in crystals when the linear growth rate was low, or bubble inclusions when the linear rate was high. The use of lower molten zone temperatures was found to give pale-yellow crystals, while crystals grown using higher molten zone temperatures tended to be blue in colour. Variation of oxygen pressure in the growth chamber (between 1√ó105 and 5√ó105Pa) was found to have little effect on either crystal quality or colour."

   abstract = { We present a computationally efficient and predictive methodology for modeling the formation and properties of electron and hole polarons in solids. Through a nonempirical and self-consistent optimization of the fraction of Hartree‚ÄìFock exchange (Œ±) in a hybrid functional, we ensure the generalized Koopmans‚Äô condition is satisfied and self-interaction error is minimized. The approach is applied to model polaron formation in known stable and metastable phases of TiO2 including anatase, rutile, brookite, TiO2(H), TiO2(R), and TiO2(B). Electron polarons are predicted to form in rutile, TiO2(H), and TiO2(R) (with trapping energies ranging from ‚àí0.02 eV to ‚àí0.35 eV). In rutile the electron localizes on a single Ti ion, whereas in TiO2(H) and TiO2(R) the electron is distributed across two neighboring Ti sites. Hole polarons are predicted to form in anatase, brookite, TiO2(H), TiO2(R), and TiO2(B) (with trapping energies ranging from ‚àí0.16 eV to ‚àí0.52 eV). In anatase, brookite, and TiO2(B) holes localize on a single O ion, whereas in TiO2(H) and TiO2(R) holes can also be distributed across two O sites. We find that the optimized Œ± has a degree of transferability across the phases, with Œ± = 0.115 describing all phases well. We also note the approach yields accurate band gaps, with anatase, rutile, and brookite within six percent of experimental values. We conclude our study with a comparison of the alignment of polaron charge transition levels across the different phases. Since the approach we describe is only two to three times more expensive than a standard density functional theory calculation, it is ideally suited to model charge trapping at complex defects (such as surfaces and interfaces) in a range of materials relevant for technological applications but previously inaccessible to predictive modeling.}

In photocatalysis and other applications, TiO2 is often reduced, behaving as an n-type semiconductor with unique physico-chemical properties. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the fundamental properties and applications of excess electrons in reduced, undoped TiO2. We discuss the characteristics of excess electrons in the bulk and at the surface of rutile and anatase TiO2 focusing on their localization, spatial distribution, energy levels, and dynamical properties. We examine specific features of the electronic states for photoexcited TiO2, for intrinsic oxygen vacancy and Ti interstitial defects, and for surface hydroxyls. We discuss similarities and differences in the behaviors of excess electrons in the rutile and anatase phases. Finally, we consider the effect of excess electrons on the reactivity, focusing on the interaction between excess electrons and adsorbates."
