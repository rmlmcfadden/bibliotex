   abstract = "The cubic spinel oxides Li1+xTi2−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) are promising anode materials for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. The end member of the Li–Ti–O series{,} Li4Ti5O12{,} can accommodate Li ions up to the composition Li7Ti5O12. Whereas a number of studies focus on the electrochemical behaviour of Li insertion into and Li diffusion in the Li intercalated material{,} only few investigations about low-temperature Li dynamics in the non-intercalated host material Li4Ti5O12 have been reported so far. In the present paper{,} Li diffusion in pure-phase microcrystalline Li4Ti5O12 with an average particle size in the μm range was probed by 7Li solid state NMR spectroscopy using spin-alignment echo (SAE) and spin–lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements. Between T = 295 K and 400 K extremely slow Li jump rates τ−1 ranging from 1 s−1 to about 2200 s−1 were directly measured by recording the decay of spin-alignment echoes as a function of mixing time and constant evolution time. The results point out the slow Li diffusion in non-intercalated Li4Ti5O12· τ−1 (1/T) follows Arrhenius behaviour with an activation energy EASAE of about 0.86 eV. Interestingly{,} EASAE is comparable to activation energies deduced from conductivity measurements (0.94(1) eV) and from SLR measurements in the rotating frame (0.74(2) eV) rather than from those performed in the laboratory frame{,} EAlow-T = 0.26(1) eV at low T."

   abstract = "We studied the local structure and the Li ion dynamics in electrochemically and chemically prepared Li4+xTi5O12 with x=0…5. We used magic-angle spinning 7Li NMR on samples with different Li contents to investigate the sites that are occupied/emptied during Li insertion/removal. While the electrochemical measurements show a lithium insertion in two steps, 1D MAS NMR as a function of the lithium content shows that the overall spectral evolution observed during lithium insertion is inverted during lithium removal. Thereby the second insertion step is associated with an increased structural disorder. For samples with x=0, 2, 3, and about 5, we performed temperature-dependent measurements of the 7Li NMR relaxation rates T1−1, T2−1, and T1ρ−1 to study the dynamics of the Li ions. For the samples with x=0, 2, and 3, activation energies of (0.45±0.1)eV were obtained. The highest mobility of the Li ions is observed for the samples with x=2 and 3. Results from 6Li and 7Li 2D exchange MAS NMR spectroscopy on samples with x=2 and 4 show that magnetization transfer for 7Li below 323K is dominated by spin diffusion."

   abstract = {Lithium titanate (LTO) is one of the most promising anode materials for large-scale stationary electrochemical storage of energy produced from renewable sources. Besides many other aspects, such as negligible formation of passivation layers and no volume expansion during lithiation, the success of LTO is mainly based on its ability to easily accommodate and release Li ions in a fully reversible way. This feature is tightly connected with Li self-diffusion. As yet, little information is available about microscopic Li diffusion properties and elementary steps of Li hopping at low intercalation levels, i.e., at values of x being significantly smaller than 1. Here, we used 7Li spin-locking NMR relaxometry to probe absolute hopping rates of LTO (homogeneous) solid solutions in quasi-thermodynamic equilibrium. As a result, the largest increase of Li diffusivity is observed when small amounts of Li are inserted. Strong Coulomb repulsions caused by the simultaneous occupation of neighboring 8a and 16c sites serve as an explanation for the enhanced Li diffusivity found. At even larger values of x, Li mobility slows down but is still much faster than in the host material with x = 0. Our results experimentally corroborate the outcome of recently published calculations on the DFT level focusing on both dynamic and structural aspects. The findings favor the formation of LTO solid solutions upon chemical lithiation; the steep increase in Li diffusivity found might also help with understanding the flat insertion potential observed.}

   abstract = {One of the most widely known anode materials with excellent cycling performance in lithium-ion batteries is zero-strain lithium titanate Li4Ti5O12 (LTO). This is based on the highly reversible insertion and deinsertion of Li ions varying the composition of Li4+xTi5O12 from x = 0 to x = 3. The facile incorporation of Li is tightly connected with bulk Li ion dynamics. Although macroscopic electrochemical properties have been studied in great detail, bulk Li ion diffusion pathways have rarely been probed experimentally from an atomic scale point of view. Here, we evaluated 1D and 2D 6Li magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra recorded as a function of x to make the local magnetic changes during Li insertion visible. This enabled us to directly show that rapid Li exchange involves the 8a and 16c sites, forming a 3D network throughout the LTO spinel structure. In contrast, considering the time scale set by our NMR experiments, the Li ions residing on the mixed occupied octahedral positions 16d are quite immobile. Under the MAS conditions applied, they definitely do not participate in rapid Li self-diffusion as evidenced by rather long site-specific longitudinal relaxation times as well as the absence of any NMR coalescence effects. Based on the NMR spectra, we propose a refined Li insertion mechanism which includes the initial formation of a highly conducting quasi solid solution characterized by rapid Li ion exchange.}

   abstract = "Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) belongs to one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Its superior cycling performance and negligible aging make it a potential candidate to be used in, e.g., stationary applications. Besides this application-oriented interest it serves as an excellent model system to study Li ion transport in a 3D mixed conducting host crystallizing with spinel structure. Whereas Li ion diffusion in Li4Ti5O12 was the subject of several studies that appeared over the past years; Li ion transport in mixed conducting Li7Ti5O12 crystallizing with rock-salt type structure is, however, much less frequently investigated. Li7Ti5O12 is the compound that is formed after an LTO-type battery has been fully charged. In the present study we used spin-lock NMR relaxometry to quantify Li ion diffusion in terms of jump rates, activation energies and microscopic Li ion self-diffusion coefficients. Extending the measurements to higher temperatures enabled us to record the diffusion induced rate maxima from which Li+ self-diffusion coefficients were obtained directly. Compared to the non-lithiated source material Li4Ti5O12, showing poor Li ion diffusivity, Li ion diffusivity in Li7Ti5O12 is clearly enhanced but by far as high as recently reported for spinel-type Li4+xTi5O12, with x being significantly smaller than 1. Obviously, the small number of vacant 16c sites in Li7Ti5O12 as well as repulsive the 8a–16c interactions are responsible for the low Li ion diffusivity found."

A clear correlation between mobility and NMR spectral features was observed{,} suggesting the presence of local domains with high Li ion mobility. The long-range mobility is limited by the much slower hopping between such domains and appears to be faster for either larger or less ordered local domains. For x ≈ 1.6{,} spectral features indicate the formation of separate stoichiometric and overlithiated phases rather than a solid solution{,} yet no segregation into a fast and a slow component was observed in the relaxation and in the SAE dimension{,} which points towards an entangling of the two phases on a microscopic scale."
