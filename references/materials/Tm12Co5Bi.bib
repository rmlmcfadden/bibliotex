   abstract = "The local magnetic properties of Tm12Co5Bi were investigated using muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), showing unusual magnetic features. Below 0.27 T, any magnetic transition in the sample occurs below ∼ 3 K while at 2.7 and 5 T, there is a magnetic transition in the range 10--30 K. These results constitute a possibility of a phase transition from an antiferromagnetic ground state to a short-ranged magnetic phase at the local level.",
