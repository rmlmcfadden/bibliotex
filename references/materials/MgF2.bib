   abstract = "Conductivity, σ, of MnF2 and MgF2 single crystals, pure and doped (with Li+, Na+, Y3+, Gd3+), has been measured, from room temperature to 500°C. Further, some crystals were contaminated with O2− as an additional impurity. These tetragonal (rutile structure) crystals both behave like typical ionic conductors. Of particular interest is the existence of a large anisotropy, σ being largest when measured parallel to the c-axis. Study of the conductivity isotherms and anisotropy as functions of impurity concentration allows identification of the conduction mechanism in terms of the migration of two mobile defects: the fiuorine-ion vacancy, VF, and interstitial, Fi. A value of 1.44 eV was obtained for the enthalpy of formation of the intrinsic anion Frenkel defect, 0.80 eV for the migration enthalpy of a VF and 0.88 eV for an F1 in MnF2 parallel to the c-axis. Similar values were obtained for MgF2. This work shows that more information about point defects can be obtained from conductivity measurements in non-cubic cyrstals than in cubic ionic crystals, because of the additional information from conductivity anisotropy."

   abstract={The defect structure of LiF-doped (tetragonal) crystals of MgF 2 is determined from a study of anelastic and dielectric relaxation, employing samples with various characteristic orientations. No loss peaks are found, except in the case of internal friction of (100)-oriented samples, for which a Debye peak is observed at -53 degrees C for a frequency of 8 kHz. It is established that this peak is due to an Li-Li interstitial pair which replaces a single Mg 2+ ion and resides on a (001) plane. The activation enthalpy for relaxation (0.41 eV) is attributed to the rotational flip-flop of the pair between two equivalent orientations.}

   abstract={The authors present results of a theoretical study of the defect properties of Li + doped MgF 2 . The basic structure of the defect solution involves the creation of a self-compensated defect population of Li substitutionals and interstitials. These cluster to give a structure in which two Li + ions occupy one cation site-a defect already proposed for these crystals by Kim and Nowick (Bull. Am. Phys. Soc., vol.21, p.265 (1976) and J. Phys. C, vol.10, p.509 (1976)). The authors also consider transport properties of the doped materials, and suggest that interstitial Li + plays a major role.}
