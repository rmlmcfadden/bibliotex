	% abstract = {Using the small-polaron theory of diffusion we obtain a very good fit of the experimental data on hydrogen diffusion in tantalum between 15 and 500 K. It is shown that the phenomenon has three regimes: (a) At T > 250 K the transport occurs mainly by hydrogen tunneling between tetrahedral sites. (b) At 200 K >T > 15 K metastable states having octahedral symmetry play the main role. (c) The dominance of tetrahedral diffusion restarts at T < 10 K.}
