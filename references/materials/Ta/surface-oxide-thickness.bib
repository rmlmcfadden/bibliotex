	abstract = {Abstract Over the past decades, superconducting qubits have emerged as one of the leading hardware platforms for realizing a quantum processor. Consequently, researchers have made significant effort to understand the loss channels that limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits. A major source of loss has been attributed to two level systems that are present at the material interfaces. It is recently shown that replacing the metal in the capacitor of a transmon with tantalum yields record relaxation and coherence times for superconducting qubits, motivating a detailed study of the tantalum surface. In this work, the chemical profile of the surface of tantalum films grown on c-plane sapphire using variable energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VEXPS) is studied. The different oxidation states of tantalum that are present in the native oxide resulting from exposure to air are identified, and their distribution through the depth of the film is measured. Furthermore, it is shown how the volume and depth distribution of these tantalum oxidation states can be altered by various chemical treatments. Correlating these measurements with detailed measurements of quantum devices may elucidate the underlying microscopic sources of loss.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many metals form nanometer-thin self-passivating oxide layers upon exposure to the atmosphere, which affects a wide range of interfacial properties and shapes the way how metals interact with their environment. Such native oxide layers are commonly analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which provides a depth-resolved chemical state and compositional analysis either by ion etching or modeling of the electron escape depths. The latter is commonly used to calculate the average thickness of a native oxide layer. However, the measurement of concentration profiles at the oxide-metal interface remains challenging. Here, a simple and accessible approach for the depth profiling of ultrathin oxide layers within single fixed-angle XPS spectra is proposed. Instead of using only one peak in the spectrum, as is usually the case, all peaks within the energy range of a standard lab device are utilized, thus resembling energy-resolved XPS without the need for a synchrotron. New models that allow the calculation of depth-resolved concentration profiles at the oxide-metal interface are derived and tested, which are also valid for angular- and energy-resolved XPS. The proposed method not only improves the accuracy of earlier approaches but also paves the way for a more holistic understanding of the XPS spectrum.},

	abstract = {Abstract Despite constituting a smaller fraction of the qubit's electromagnetic mode, surfaces and interfaces can exert significant influence as sources of high-loss tangents, which brings forward the need to reveal properties of these extended defects and identify routes to their control. Here, we examine the structure and composition of the metal-substrate interfacial layer that exists in Ta/sapphire-based superconducting films. Synchrotron-based X-ray reflectivity measurements of Ta films, commonly used in these qubits, reveal an unexplored interface layer at the metal-substrate interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy identified an intermixing layer (≈0.65 ± 0.05 nm) at the metal-substrate interface containing Al, O, and Ta atoms. Density functional theory modeling reveals that the structure and properties of the Ta/sapphire heterojunctions are determined by the oxygen content on the sapphire surface prior to Ta deposition for two atomic terminations of sapphire. Using a multimodal approach, we gained deeper insights into the interface layer between the metal and substrate, which suggests that the orientation of deposited Ta films depend on the surface termination of sapphire. The observed elemental intermixing at the metal-substrate interface influences the thermodynamic stability and electronic behavior of the film, which may also affect qubit performance.},
