	% abstract = {The magnetic susceptibility χ(T, c) of the tantalum-hydrogen system was measured in the range T ⩽ 250 K and 0.5 ⩽ c ⩽ 0.8 (c = H/Ta), χ depends strongly on the hydrogen concentration c and decreases in steps with increasing H/Ta ratio. The plateaus in the x (c) curve observed near H/Ta ratios of 12, 23 and 34 are attributed to stoichiometric compositions. The temperature dependence of χ is relatively weak. Phase transitions within the TaH system change the electronic susceptibility by approximately 1%, and may be observed clearly with a sensitive Faraday magnetometer. With the aid of differential thermal analysis results, the low temperature TaH phase diagram was established up to c = 0.8. The number of low temperature phases corresponds to the number of steps in the χ (c) measurements. This result indicates that for c ⩾ 0.5 the TaH phase diagram is determined mainly by the stoichiometry of the TaH bond.}
