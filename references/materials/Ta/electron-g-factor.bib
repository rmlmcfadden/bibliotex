	abstract = {The author presents theoretical estimates of the average over the Fermi surface of the g factor for 24 elements in the 3d, 4d and 5d transition series. The calculations were performed using a simple model in which the results depend only on crystal structure, the ratio of the spin-orbit coupling parameter to the d band width and the number of occupied d levels per atom. The g factor trends obtained are a composite of the variation of these individual factors through the transition series.}

    abstract = {The Zeeman splitting for conduction electrons in transition d-metals (vanadium, niobium, and tantalum) is investigated theoretically by the RLMTO method. The results of calculation and averaging of g-factors are presented, together with the results of analysis of their stability to variations of the density of states, and also the results of calculation of the enhancement of the Zeeman splitting of levels due to electron-electron interaction. The orbit-averaged g-factors display anisotropy on the octahedral O2 hole sheet of the Fermi surface of the second band. The results of calculations are compared with experimental results and with the results obtained by other authors. Some general regularities in the behavior of the g-factors for all transition d-metals of the cubic structure are formulated.},
