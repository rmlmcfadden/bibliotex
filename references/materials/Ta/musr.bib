	abstract = {The diffusion of positive muons in Ta has been measured between 29 K and 91 K. The results are well reproduced by an Arrhenius relationship with activation energy Ea = (41.6 ± 3.)) meV and preexponential factor ν0 = (3.0−1.3+2.6) × 109 s−1. The muon seems to be locally in a tunneling state. In addition, the neighboring Ta nuclei show a very strong quadrupole interaction.}
