At 6 K, three frequencies are observed, corresponding to a triaxial hyperfine matrix whose principal values are close to those observed for hydrogen atoms frozen into known sites. For intermediate temperatures the Mu atoms ``hop'' between sites, causing a relaxation whose rate first increases with the hop rate and then decreases due to motional narrowing. Finally, at room temperature, a single-frequency oscillation is observed, corresponding to a uniaxial motionally-averaged hyperfine interaction.",

We have observed muonium in room temperature diamond, and report on a brief study of the temperature behaviour of its asymmetry and relaxation. These results are radically different from all previous diamond results. We have not been able to detect any Mu in SrTiO3, ZrSiO4, or TiO2, but in GeO2 there is a tiny signal in both a fused sample and a hexagonal single crystal, but none in a tetragonal crystal. Since hexagonal GeO2 is structurally similar to quartz, one would naively expect similar amounts of Mu. Such is not the case, the reasons for which are not understood at this time. In SrTiO3, the muon asymmetry is a strong function of temperature.",

	abstract = {By periodically reversing the direction of an electric field E applied to a thin sheet of SiO2, buildup of uncollected charges on the surfaces of the sample was prevented and the effect of E on delayed muonium formation in quartz was observed for the first time. The results indicate that the μ+ stops about 10–15 nm “downstream” of most of its radiolysis electrons in crystalline quartz. In fused silica this distance is nearly a factor of two shorter and there is a “missing fraction”, probably due to lower mobility of free electrons.}
