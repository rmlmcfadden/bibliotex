Signals from the 125Te isotope were detected by the spin echo method in the range from 10 K to room temperature. It was found that the NMR spectrum consists of two lines. The line with a positive shift of the resonance frequency corresponded to the bulk of the sample. The line with a negative shift was interpreted as a signal from the surface of the single crystal. The temperature and orientational dependences of the positions of the NMR line of nuclei in the bulk of the crystal were studied. It was shown that the shifts are mainly determined by the Knight shift due to the interaction with mobile charge carriers. The thermoactivation character of the concentration of mobile charges in the crystal under study, which corresponds to the intrinsic conductance, was proved, and the energy parameters of the thermoactivation processes were calculated.",

The NMR spectra of the single-crystal plates have been studied in the orientation where the crystallographic axis c is directed parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field. The spectra have been obtained by means of recording spin-echo signals and plotting their envelopes. It has been shown that the NMR spectra for the bismuth telluride powder and plates with the orientation c ⊥ B consist of two lines, which are presumably attributed to tellurium nuclei in two crystallographic positions in the bulk of the sample. The position and shape of the lines are determined by the chemical shift and the Knight shift. For the orientation of the plates c || B, the spectrum contains an additional component in the high-frequency region, which cannot appear due to the angular dependence of the line shifts caused by tellurium nuclei in the bulk of the topological insulator. At a low temperature, the additional line dominates in the spectrum.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the beam creates defects within its penetration range giving rise to delocalized charge carriers, thereby making further 125Te NMR Knight shift and line broadening. Upon increasing temperature, the NMR line narrowing manifests the activated motions of thermally excited charge carriers in the irradiated sample. In contrast, it reveals that in the unirradiated sample the free-charge carriers at the Fermi level dominantly contribute to the Knight shift. Our results show that the orbital contribution to the Knight shift in the bulk state of Bi2Te3 becomes predominant in the system with the higher density of defects, as evidenced by modified electronic structures induced by the beam irradiation."

Bi2Se3 is a model compound, and 209Bi NMR is employed here to investigate the bulk properties of the material with focus on the quadrupole splitting. It will be shown that this splitting measures the energy band inversion induced by spin-orbit coupling in quantitative agreement with first-principle calculations. Furthermore, this quadrupole interaction is very unusual as it can show essentially no angular dependence, e.g., even at the magic angle the first-order splitting remains. Therefore, it is proposed that the magnetic field direction is involved in setting the quantization axis for the electrons, and that their life time leads to a new electronically driven relaxation mechanism, in particular for quadrupolar nuclei like 209Bi. While a quantitative understanding of these effects cannot be given, the results implicate that NMR can become a powerful tool for the investigation of such systems."
