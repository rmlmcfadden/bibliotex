   abstract = {Abstract The oscillatory magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) was observed on n-type Bi2See single crystals between 1.6 and 4.2 K. The electron concentrations ranged from about 4 × 1017 to 4 × 1019 cm−3. Stationary magnetic fields up to 10.5 T were available. The angular dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas periods revealed an almost rotational symmetry of the Fermi surface around the kc = 0 a parabolic ε(k⊥) relation is found, parallel to the kc-axis an increasing nonparabolicity is evaluated. Only above 1019 electrons/cm3 the deviation of the shape of the Fermi surface from that of an ellipsoid of rotational symmetry becomes significant. The cyclotron mass mc perpendicular to the kc-axis (B ‖c) is determined to be 0.124 m0 in the whole concentration range. Fermi energies are evaluated up to 160 meV. The single-valley model for the lowest conduction band of Bi2See is confirmed.},

   abstract = {Abstract The oscillatory part of the magneto-resistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) was investigated on n-Bi2Se3 single crystals with carrier concentrations between 5 × 1017 and 1 × 1018cm−3 in the temperature range from 1.6 to 4.2 K in pulsed magnetic fields up to 35 T (350 kG) magnetic induction. Most experiments were performed for the magnetic induction B parallel to the trigonal axis c of the crystals, where the smallest cyclotron mass mc and a parabolic ε(κ) relation is present. No spin-splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas resistivity extrema is observed at high quantum numbers. At low quantum numbers the influence of spin-splitting causes a shift of the resistivity extrema and an additional maximum, which should not be present for M = gmc/(2m0) ≪ 1. A calculation of the magnetoresistance in quantizing magnetic fields based on Kubo's theory for a field-independent carrier concentration enables the determination of the expression M = gmc/(2m0) = 2 with ±5\% uncertainty for B‖ c. The absolute value of the g-factor is evaluated hence as (32 ± 3) for B‖ c. For arbitrary crystal orientation in the magnetic field M may be assumed to be constant within the error margin, the g-factor being consequently smaller for B ⟂ c: g ⟂ = (23 ± 3).},

   abstract = "Single crystals of Bi2Se3 doped with Mn (cMn=0–3.0×1019atoms/cm3) were grown using a modified Bridgman method. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis, and subsequently investigated by measurements of the reflectivity in the plasma-resonance-frequency region and by measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the magnetization, specific heat and transport properties. The results show that incorporation of Mn atoms in the crystal structure leads to an increase of the free-electron concentration, as well as to an increase of the mobility of the free electrons. The Mn2+ valence state of the Mn ions has been established by magnetic measurements, which show a different behavior than the scenario proposed by Choi et al. [J. Choi, H.-W. Lee, B.-S. Kim, S. Choi, J. Choi, J. H. Song and S. Cho, J. Appl. Phys. 97, 10D324 (2005)]. The observations are explained in terms of the point-defect model, which is based on the idea that the Mn impurities create substitutional defects of the Mn′Bi-type and reduce the concentration of antistructure Bi′Se defects."

The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.},

   abstract = {Bismuth selenide – the prominent topological insulator – has been recently reported as a material exhibiting an extraordinary strong Faraday rotation. This effect has been identified as due to interband excitations in bulk promoting electrons from the valence to the conduction band, in which the electron gas is partially spin-polarized due to the Zeeman effect. In this work, we test the Faraday rotation in Bi2Se3 in high magnetic fields, when the conduction band electrons reach their full spin polarization. We find that the Faraday angle becomes in this regime almost independent of the applied magnetic field. This contrasts with the Faraday effect observed in this system at low magnetic fields, where the Faraday angle scales linearly with B and may thus be described by a conventional Verdet law.}

Here we report on a combined magneto-transport, photoluminescence and infrared transmission study of Bi2Se3, which unambiguously shows that the energy band gap of this material is direct and reaches Eg = (220 ± 5) meV at low temperatures.",

   anstract = "Helically spin-polarized Dirac fermions (HSDF) in protected topological surface states (TSS) are of high interest as a new state of quantum matter. In three-dimensional (3D) materials with TSS, electronic bulk states often mask the transport properties of HSDF. Recently, the high-field Hall resistance and low-field magnetoresistance indicate that the TSS may coexist with a layered two-dimensional electronic system (2DES). Here, we demonstrate quantum oscillations of the Hall resistance at temperatures up to 50 K in nominally undoped bulk Bi2Se3 with a high electron density n of about 2·1019 cm−3. From the angular and temperature dependence of the Hall resistance and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations we identify 3D and 2D contributions to transport. Angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy proves the existence of TSS. We present a model for Bi2Se3 and suggest that the coexistence of TSS and 2D layered transport stabilizes the quantum oscillations of the Hall resistance.",
