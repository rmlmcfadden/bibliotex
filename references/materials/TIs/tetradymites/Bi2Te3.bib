Bi 2 Te 3 is diamagnetic and χ parallel has the larger algebraic value. The contributions to the susceptibility from the core and valence electrons, free carriers and impurities are discussed, and it is suggested that the effect of the impurities is negligible, the free carriers give rise to a paramagnetic contribution and the main contribution is from the core and valence electrons.}

	abstract = {In addition to an energy gap, which is a characteristic of all band insulators, the electronic structure of the recently discovered three-dimensional topological insulators Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 contains a surface state with a Dirac-like dispersion. This state is predicted to be associated with high carrier mobility. However, the transport properties of the surface state are obscured by the bulk material and challenging to measure. Qu et al. (p. 821, published online 29 July) produced crystals of Bi2Te3 with the Fermi energy lying in the bulk gap and detected quantum oscillations whose magnetic field dependence reveals that they come from a two-dimensional Fermi surface. An anomaly in the Hall conductance originating from the surface state was also observed. The two measurements independently yield mutually consistent high electron mobilities.Topological insulators are insulating materials that display massless, Dirac-like surface states in which the electrons have only one spin degree of freedom on each surface. These states have been imaged by photoemission, but little information on their transport parameters, for example, mobility, is available. We report the observation of Shubnikov{\textendash}de Haas oscillations arising from the surface states in nonmetallic crystals of Bi2Te3. In addition, we uncovered a Hall anomaly in weak fields, which enables the surface current to be seen directly. Both experiments yield a surface mobility (9000 to 10,000 centimeter2 per volt-second) that is substantially higher than in the bulk. The Fermi velocity of 4 {\texttimes} 105 meters per second obtained from these transport experiments agrees with angle-resolved photoemission experiments.},

   abstract = {Breaking the time reversal symmetry of a topological insulator, for example by the presence of magnetic ions, is a prerequisite for spin-based electronic applications in the future. In this regard Mn-doped Bi2Te3 is a prototypical example that merits a systematic investigation of its magnetic properties. Unfortunately, Mn doping is challenging in many host materials—resulting in structural or chemical inhomogeneities affecting the magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic study of the structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of Mn-doped Bi2Te3 single crystals using complimentary experimental techniques. These materials exhibit a ferromagnetic phase that is very sensitive to the structural details, with TC varying between 9 and 13 K (bulk values) and a saturation moment that reaches 4.4(5) μB per Mn in the ordered phase. Muon spin rotation suggests that the magnetism is homogeneous throughout the sample. Furthermore, torque measurements in fields up to 33 T reveal an easy axis magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the ab-plane. The electrical transport data show an anomaly around TC that is easily suppressed by an applied magnetic field, and also anisotropic behavior due to the spin-dependent scattering in relation to the alignment of the Mn magnetic moment. Hall measurements on different crystals established that these systems are n-doped with carrier concentrations of ∼ 0.5–3.0 × 1020 cm−3. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Mn L2,3 edge at 1.8 K reveals a large spin magnetic moment of 4.3(3) μB/Mn, and a small orbital magnetic moment of 0.18(2) μB/Mn. The results also indicate a ground state of mixed d4–d5–d6 character of a localized electronic nature, similar to the diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor Ga1−xMnxAs. XMCD measurements in a field of 6 T give a transition point at T ≈ 16 K, which is ascribed to short range magnetic order induced by the magnetic field. In the ferromagnetic state the easy direction of magnetization is along the c-axis, in agreement with bulk magnetization measurements. This could lead to gap opening at the Dirac point, providing a means to control the surface electric transport, which is of great importance for applications.}

	abstract = {Topological insulators form a novel state of matter that open up new opportunities to create unique quantum particles. Although theoretical studies have proposed an abundance of new phenomena, many of the predictions still await their experimental verification, not to mention their implementation into applications. The main obstacle is material quality and cleanliness of the experimental conditions. The presence of tiny amounts of defects in the bulk or contaminants at the surface masks these phenomena. Here we show that for Bi2Te3, it is possible to obtain the desired quality by carrying out the preparation and characterization all under ultra-high-vacuum conditions. In situ four-point conductance measurements revealed the charge carriers moving on the surface with very high values of mobility.Topological insulators represent a novel state of matter with surface charge carriers having a massless Dirac dispersion and locked helical spin polarization. Many exciting experiments have been proposed by theory, yet their execution has been hampered by the extrinsic conductivity associated with the unavoidable presence of defects in Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 bulk single crystals, as well as impurities on their surfaces. Here we present the preparation of Bi2Te3 thin films that are insulating in the bulk and the four-point probe measurement of the conductivity of the Dirac states on surfaces that are intrinsically clean. The total amount of charge carriers in the experiment is of the order of 1012 cm-2 only, and mobilities up to 4,600 cm2/Vs have been observed. These values are achieved by carrying out the preparation, structural characterization, angle-resolved and X-ray photoemission analysis, and temperature-dependent four-point probe conductivity measurement all in situ under ultra-high-vacuum conditions. This experimental approach opens the way to prepare devices that can exploit the intrinsic topological properties of the Dirac surface states.},
