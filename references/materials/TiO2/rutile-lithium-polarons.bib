	%abstract = "Carrier mobility in titanium dioxide (TiO2) systems is a key factor for their application as energy materials{,} especially in solar cells and lithium-ion batteries. Studies on the diffusion of Li-ions and polarons in rutile TiO2 systems have attracted extensive attention. However{,} how their interaction affects the diffusion of Li-ions and electron polarons is largely unclear and related studies are relatively lacking. By using first-principles calculations{,} we systematically investigate the interaction between the intercalated Li-ions and electron polarons in rutile TiO2 materials. Our analysis shows that the diffusion barrier of the electron polarons decreases around the Li-ion. The interaction between the Li-ions and polarons would benefit their synergistic diffusion both in the pristine and defective rutile TiO2 systems. Our study reveals the synergistic effects between the ions and polarons{,} which is important for understanding the carrier properties in TiO2 systems and in further improving the performance of energy materials.",
