	abstract = {The formation and migration energies of interstitial hydrogen in rutile TiO2 are obtained from first principles calculations. The computational approach was based on density functional theory with a semilocal generalised-gradient approximation functional, supplemented with an on-site Hubbard term to account for correlation among the Ti 3d electrons. Charge-transition levels are calculated and compared to previous theoretical studies. The donor character of hydrogen is examined in depth, focusing in particular on the tendency to form polaron-like configurations with the unpaired electron trapped at nearby titanium ions. Distinct minimum-energy paths of hydrogen migration and associated energy barriers were determined by the nudged elastic-band method. The present findings show clearly the strong anisotropy in the energy barriers for migration within the open c channels as opposed to migration crossing adjacent channels of the rutile lattice. For the rate-limiting step which leads to macroscopic diffusion along the c axis the corresponding rate and diffusion coefficient were also determined from transition-state theory. The results are discussed in connection to existing measurements of hydrogen diffusion and recent findings from electron paramagnetic resonance, electronâ€“nuclear double resonance and muonium spectroscopies that probed the spatial localization of the electron spin.}
