We show that this oxide metal has a fairly large electron-electron interaction which gives rise to a T12 correction to the conductivity for T < 2 K and a V12 correction to the single particle density of states near the Fermi energy. The strong interaction effects in this metal arise from the low electron diffusivity."

   abstract = {perovskites (R = rare earth) provide a remarkable opportunity to study the relationship between structural and physical properties since, by moving along the 4f rare earth series, the evolution of several transport and magnetic properties can be nicely correlated to the steric effects associated with the lanthanide contraction. The most appealing example is probably the metal - insulator transition discovered for the compounds with , whose critical temperature  increases with decreasing size of the rare earth ion. On the other hand, several experimental results show that in  perovskites the degree of Ni 3d - O 2p hybridization is extremely high. The purely ionic  configuration, first suggested by neutron diffraction experiments, has been then substituted by a ground state where the  and  configurations are strongly mixed. In this paper, a summary of the scientific work performed on the  system during the last 6 years is presented. The results of the different experimental techniques are successively reviewed, with special emphasis on the relationship between the structural and the physical properties. The possible mechanisms responsible for the metal - insulator transition, which is the major open question for  perovskites, are also discussed.}

RMO3 perovskites (R = rare earth or Y, M = 3d-block transition metal) exhibit a maximum intrinsic orthorhombic site distortion at an R3+-ion radius IR ≈ 1.11 Å and a reduction of α that increases with IR > 1.11 Å. How the universal site distortions influence Jahn–Teller cooperative orbital orderings on the M cations is illustrated in four orthorhombic perovskite families: RTiO3, RVO3, RMnO3, and RNiO3."

We have fabricated superlattices of the paramagnetic metal lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3) and the wide-gap insulator lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) with atomically precise layer sequences. We used optical ellipsometry and low-energy muon spin rotation to show that superlattices with LaNiO3 as thin as two unit cells undergo a sequence of collective metal-insulator and antiferromagnetic transitions as a function of decreasing temperature, whereas samples with thicker LaNiO3 layers remain metallic and paramagnetic at all temperatures. Metal-oxide superlattices thus allow control of the dimensionality and collective phase behavior of correlated-electron systems.},

   abstract = {A marked conductivity enhancement is reported in 6–11 unit cell LaNiO3 thin films. A maximal conductivity is also observed in ab initio calculations for films of the same thickness. In agreement with results from state of the art scanning transmission electron microscopy, the calculations also reveal a differentiated film structure comprising characteristic surface, interior, and heterointerface structures. Based on this observation, a three-element parallel conductor model is considered and leads to the conclusion that the conductivity enhancement for films of 6–11 unit cells, stems from the onset of intercompetition between the three local structures in the film depth.},

The recent theoretical prediction for superconductivity in LaNiO3 thin films has also triggered intensive research efforts. LaNiO3 seems to be the only rare earth nickelate that stays metallic and paramagnetic down to lowest temperatures. So far, centimeter-sized impurity-free single crystal growth has not been reported for the rare earth nickelates material class since elevated oxygen pressures are required for their synthesis. Here, we report on the successful growth of centimeter-sized LaNiO3 single crystals by the floating zone technique at oxygen pressures of up to 150 bar. Our crystals are essentially free from Ni2+ impurities and exhibit metallic properties together with an unexpected but clear antiferromagnetic transition.",

   abstract = "Many-body effects produce deviations from the predictions of conventional band theory in quantum materials, leading to strongly correlated phases with insulating or bad metallic behavior. One example is the rare-earth nickelates RNiO3, which undergo metal-to-insulator transitions (MITs) whose origin is debated. Here, we combine total neutron scattering and broadband dielectric spectroscopy experiments to study and compare carrier dynamics and local crystal structure in LaNiO3 and NdNiO3. We find that the local crystal structure of both materials is distorted in the metallic phase, with slow, thermally activated carrier dynamics at high temperature. We further observe a sharp change in conductivity across the MIT in NdNiO3, accompanied by slight differences in the carrier hopping time. These results suggest that changes in carrier concentration drive the MIT through a polaronic mechanism, where the (bi)polaron liquid freezes into the insulating phase across the MIT temperature.",

   abstract = {This review stands in the larger framework of functional materials by focussing on heterostructures of rare-earth nickelates, described by the chemical formula RNiO3 where R is a trivalent rare-earth R = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, …, Lu. Nickelates are characterized by a rich phase diagram of structural and physical properties and serve as a benchmark for the physics of phase transitions in correlated oxides where electron–lattice coupling plays a key role. Much of the recent interest in nickelates concerns heterostructures, that is single layers of thin film, multilayers or superlattices, with the general objective of modulating their physical properties through strain control, confinement or interface effects. We will discuss the extensive studies on nickelate heterostructures as well as outline different approaches to tuning and controlling their physical properties and, finally, review application concepts for future devices.}

Quantum confinement and epitaxial strain have been evoked as the mechanisms, although other factors such as growth-induced disorder, cation non-stoichiometry, oxygen vacancies, and substrate–film interface quality may also affect the observable properties of ultrathin films. Here we report results obtained for near-ideal LaNiO3 films with different thicknesses and terminations grown by atomic layer-by-layer laser molecular beam epitaxy on LaAlO3 substrates. We find that the room-temperature metallic behavior persists until the film thickness is reduced to an unprecedentedly small 1.5 unit cells (NiO2 termination). Electronic structure measurements using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation suggest that oxygen vacancies existing in the films also contribute to the metal-insulator transition.",

   abstract = "Rare-earth nickelates exhibit a metal–insulator transition accompanied by a structural distortion that breaks the symmetry between formerly equivalent Ni sites. The quantitative theoretical description of this coupled electronic–structural instability is extremely challenging. Here, we address this issue by simultaneously taking into account both structural and electronic degrees of freedom using a charge self-consistent combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, together with screened interaction parameters obtained from the constrained random phase approximation. Our total energy calculations show that the coupling to an electronic instability toward a charge disproportionated insulating state is crucial to stabilize the structural distortion, leading to a clear first order character of the coupled transition. The decreasing octahedral rotations across the series suppress this electronic instability and simultaneously increase the screening of the effective Coulomb interaction, thus weakening the correlation effects responsible for the metal–insulator transition. Our approach allows to obtain accurate values for the structural distortion and thus facilitates a comprehensive understanding, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the complex interplay between structural properties and electronic correlation effects across the nickelate series.",
