The reaction begins at room temperature. An homogeneous product is obtained by annealing the pellet at 200°C in vacuum or in argon. Whereas the first method leads only to the first stage compound LiC6 which is stoichiometric, pure phases of any stage may be obtained according to the composition of the initial mixture by the second method. The analysis of pure phases shows that the compounds of stages n > 1 present large variations of the stoichiometry. The unit cells of first stage LiC6 and second stage LiC12 compounds belong to P6/mmm space group with respective parameters a = 4.305 ± 0.001 Å, c = 3.706 ± 0.01 Å and a = 4.288 ± 0.002 Å, c = 7.065 ± 0.02 Å.

On observe un déplacement de Knight, indépendent de la température et de très faible valeur (∼40 ppm). La largeur de raie montre un rétrécissement à 280 K lié à la diffusion du lithium dans la matrice graphitée avec un temps de corrélation ∼10−5 s. Le couplage quadrupolaire varie de 16 à 32 kHz quand on abaisse la température. Les atomes de lithium établissent probablement une liaison de type métallique, en s'aidant des orbitales π du graphite. Signals of 7Li N.M.R. were obtained for LiC6; line shift, line width and quadrupolar coupling were measured from 200 K up to 460 K. Typical Knight shifts were observed, temperature independent, but with a very small value, showing the low metallic character of Li in this intercalation compound. The π orbitals of graphite seem to be necessary intermediates in the coupling between lithium atoms. From the line width and its change with temperature, we deduced that a mobility of lithium appears around 280 K, as in metallic lithium, with a correlation time around 10−5 s. Quadrupolar coupling varies from 17 to 32 kHz when the temperature is lowered. A corresponding value could be deduced with a point charge model, using the six neighbouring lithium atoms; but the thermal change observed needs a positive expansion coefficient, unlike graphite. Thus the screening by graphite π orbitals is also evidenced by the quadrupolar results."

Poco graphite is a well graphitized polycrystalline material. Glassy carbon has, by contrast, hardly any long range order, but XANES spectra reveal the graphite-like short range order. The diffusion of 7Li in Poco graphite and in glassy carbon was investigated at Li atomic fractions between 0.1 ppm and 300 ppm and temperatures in the range from 1000 K to 1400 K using a mass spectrometric method. Li was found to be released from Poco graphite mainly via intragranular diffusion and not by Knudsen diffusion through the open interconnected pores. The inaccessible porosity of glassy carbon is equal to the total porosity i.e. open pores are not present. The Arrhenius equations for the diffusion coefficients of Li in Poco graphite and in glassy carbon are D = 3 · 104 · exp(-2.27 eV/kT) cm2/s and D = 1.5 · 106 · exp(-3.1 eV/kT) cm2/s.},

Previously we found that Li migrates in Li doped, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite within the interplanar space, and in comparison to Poco graphite AXM-5Q1, Li is preferentially absorbed in a phenolic resin based glassy carbon. We now report on a study of Li diffusion in graphitic Matrix A3-3 which consists of graphite grains (like Poco graphite) and a phenolic resin based polymeric carbon. Specimens of Matrix A3-3 and POCO AXM-5Q1 were Li doped in a closed container at 1273 K and subsequently the Li content of the specimen was determined. The Li concentration in the binder carbon was estimated to be 10 times higher than in the graphite grains. The Li release kinetics were measured by using a mass spectrometric method and were found to conform to Fick's second law at high temperatures. At low temperatures the release rate was initially lower than expected for simple diffusion kinetics. We assume this is mainly due to a nonzero Li surface concentration. After considering the literature on the structure of polymeric carbons we conclude that micropores, and probably even more vacancies and other small defects in the graphitic layers within the bulk, are preferred Li binding sites. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of Li in graphitic Matrix A3-3 is given by D = 5.6 × 105exp(−2.62/kT) cm2s−1 in the temperature range 1100–1400 K at concentrations in the range 1.5 μgLi/gC to 12 μgLi/gC. The activation energy E for Li diffusion in Poco AXM-5Q1, graphitic Matrix A3-3, and glassy carbon increases in the order given."

   abstract ={Electrochemical intercalation of lithium into carbons has been studied using mesophase‐pitch‐based carbon fibers with different heat‐treatment temperatures, coke, and graphites as anodes for secondary lithium batteries. The variations in the average layer spacing and the voltage profile for the carbons with intercalating depend on the degree of graphitization. The intercalation into a more disordered carbon fiber heated at 900°C has been characterized as intercalation into the layer structure for 0 < x < 0.5 in LixC6, but additional lithium insertion into an unorganized carbon loses the layer structure. The polarization resistance (RP) estimated from the impedance spectrum decreased by increasing degree of graphitization. The variation in RP with intercalation revealed the intercalation processes in various disordered carbons to be single‐phase reactions with different stoichiometries of lithium intercalation. The chemical diffusion coefficient DLi of lithium ions in carbons decreased by increasing the composition x in LixC6 up to x = 0.5.The chemical diffusion coefficient was considerably affected by the texture and the degree of graphitization of the carbons. The graphitized carbon fiber heated at 3000°C for 0.1 < x 0.5 in LixC6 exhibited one order magnitude larger values of DLi than those of graphites. The rapid diffusion in the graphitized carbon fiber has been attributed to the radial texture in the cross section. It has been found that the activation energy for the diffusion process decreased by increasing the degree of graphitization.},

The evolution of the magnitude and anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of the heat-treated carbon samples with HTT explains well these findings.

This value increases by a factor of two when HOPG is exposed to hydrogen plasma before lithium deposition. The implications resulting from the Li–graphite intercalation in lithium wall conditioning are discussed, focusing on Li-induced suppression of graphite sputtering."

   abstract = {Lithium diffusion in a stage-1 structure of LiC6 has been theoretically investigated from first principles on the basis of transition state theory. The calculated chemical diffusion coefficient of lithium atoms under the lithium excess conditions is much larger than that under the lithium deficient conditions, e.g., 2 × 10−7 cm2/s vs 1 × 10−10 cm2/s at room temperature. The calculated activation energies of the chemical diffusion coefficients under the lithium excess and deficient conditions are also different, e.g., 0.30 and 0.49 eV, respectively. The fast diffusion under the lithium excess conditions is attributed to the “interstitialcy” mechanism. These results mean that a small deviation of lithium composition from the exact composition of LiC6 causes a large difference in the lithium diffusion coefficient. The off-stoichiometry can be the major reason why the experimental diffusion coefficients and activation energies are widely scattered.}

   abstract = { Graphitic carbon is currently considered the state-of-the-art material for the negative electrode in lithium ion cells, mainly due to its high reversibility and low operating potential. However, carbon anodes exhibit mediocre charge/discharge rate performance, which contributes to severe transport-induced surface structural damage upon prolonged cycling and limits the lifetime of the cell. Lithium bulk diffusion in graphitic carbon is not yet completely understood, partly due to the complexity of measuring bulk transport properties in finite-sized nonisotropic particles. To solve this problem for graphite, we use the Devanathan−Stachurski electrochemical methodology combined with ab initio computations to deconvolute and quantify the mechanism of lithium ion diffusion in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The results reveal inherent high lithium ion diffusivity in the direction parallel to the graphene plane (∼10−7−10−6 cm2 s−1), as compared to sluggish lithium ion transport along grain boundaries (∼10−11 cm2 s−1), indicating the possibility of rational design of carbonaceous materials and composite electrodes with very high rate capability.}

A very small diffusion activation energy (0.16 ± 0.02 eV; 15.4 ± 1.8 kJ/mol) is found for Li surface diffusion across the graphite basal plane. A model involving diffusion-rate-limited Li atom transport across the basal plane of graphite through step edge sites into the interior is proposed. These measurements indicate that the diffusion coefficient, D, for Li is very large (D(300 K) ≈ 5 × 10–6 cm2 s–1).}

We use continuous, in situ, operando 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to show, in real time, the progressive intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium in graphite when a battery is charged and discharged. We obtain all the Li–graphite intercalation compound stages through an electrochemical path. We explain the overvoltages by transient entropic and Peltier effects. The sample is a plastic cell, NMR compatible, made of commercial graphite, commercial electrolyte and lithium metal foil. We analyze the NMR characteristics of the Li–GIC stages: line shift, quadrupolar frequencies, line width (Li diffusion), line intensity and area as a function of x=Li/C6. This allows us to estimate the lithium quantities in each stage at each step. Two facts differ from the theoretical stage n formation: for the C/20 cycling rate, we find an hysteresis in the filling/emptying of the dilute (LiC9n) stages, and we find another NMR line synchronous with LiC6. The lithium metal line also provides quantitative information on the lithium deposited as dendrites when x diminishes, in de-intercalation. This paper presents experimental NMR data over two cycles, and is an extension of the first cycle analysis published earlier."

Calculated properties obtained with a gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) method and a dispersion-corrected DFT method (DFT-D3-BJ) are compared. The DFT-D3-BJ method gives better agreement with experiment for the structural parameters and Li intercalation energy compared to the uncorrected DFT approach, showing that interlayer interactions due to the van der Waals forces play an effective role in graphite and LiC6n compounds. In agreement with the literature, the calculated density of states (DOS) show that graphite is metallic with a low DOS at the Fermi level, whereas LiC6n compounds have a high DOS at the Fermi level. Between the considered point defects, VLi and Lii, the energy needed to form Li point defects is smaller if solid Li is used as reference. A moderate relaxation is observed for the atoms surrounding the Li defect. Competing pathways for Li diffusion in LiC6n compounds are investigated using the climbing-image nudged elastic band approach. Two different mechanisms for Li diffusion are observed, the vacancy mechanism and the Frenkel mechanism. For both cases, Li migration pathways along the ab plane and along the c crystallographic axis are investigated. A large activation barrier along the c crystallographic direction indicates that Li does not diffuse in the c direction. The calculated activation barriers for Li diffusion in the ab plane are consistent with previous experimental investigations.}

   abstract = { Graphitic carbon is still the most ubiquitously used anode material in Li-ion batteries. In spite of its ubiquity, there are few theoretical studies that fully capture the energetics and kinetics of Li in graphite and related nanostructures at experimentally relevant length, time-scales, and Li-ion concentrations. In this paper, we describe the development and application of a ReaxFF reactive force field to describe Li interactions in perfect and defective carbon-based materials using atomistic simulations. We develop force field parameters for Li–C systems using van der Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT). Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Li intercalation in perfect graphite with this new force field not only give a voltage profile in good agreement with known experimental and DFT results but also capture the in-plane Li ordering and interlayer separations for stage I and II compounds. In defective graphite, the ratio of Li/C (i.e., the capacitance increases and voltage shifts) both in proportion to the concentration of vacancy defects and metallic lithium is observed to explain the lithium plating seen in recent experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of the force field by simulating model carbon nanostructures (i.e., both 0D and 1D structures) that can be potentially used as battery electrode materials. Whereas a 0D defective onion-like carbon facilitates fast charging/discharging rates by surface Li adsorption, a 1D defect-free carbon nanorod requires a critical density of Li for intercalation to occur at the edges. Our force field approach opens the opportunity for studying energetics and kinetics of perfect and defective Li/C structures containing thousands of atoms as a function of intercalation. This is a key step toward modeling of realistic carbon materials for energy applications. }

There is minimal reactivity between LiC6 and N2, CO2 or O2; however, LiC6 reacts with moisture to form lithium (hydr)oxide. The reaction rate follows zero-order kinetics with respects to intercalated lithium suggesting that lithium transport through the graphite is fast. The reaction occurs by sequential formation of higher stages–LiC12, then LiC18, and then LiC24–as the hydrolysis proceeds to the formation of LixOHy and graphite end products.

   abstract = { Lithium intercalation into graphite is a critical process in energy storage technology. Studies of Li intercalation kinetics have proved challenging due to structural and phase complexity, and sample heterogeneity. Here we report direct time- and space-resolved, all-optical measurement of Li intercalation. We use a single crystal graphite electrode with lithographically defined disc geometry. All-optical, Raman and reflectance measurements distinguish the intrinsic intercalation process from side reactions, and provide new insight into the microscopic intercalation process. The recently proposed Cahn–Hilliard reaction (CHR) theory quantitatively captures the observed phase front spatial patterns and dynamics, using a two-layer free-energy model with novel, generalized Butler–Volmer kinetics. This approach unites Cahn–Hilliard and electrochemical kinetics, using a thermodynamically consistent description of the Li injection reaction at the crystal edge that involves a cooperative opening of graphene planes. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory presented here, with single-crystal resolution, provides strong support for the CHR theory of solid-state reactions. }

   abstract = "In order to study a diffusive behavior of Li+ in Li intercalated graphites{,} we have measured muon spin relaxation (μ+SR) spectra for C6Li and C12Li synthesized with an electrochemical reaction between Li and graphite in a Li-ion battery. For both compounds{,} it was found that Li+ ions start to diffuse above 230 K and the diffusive behavior obeys a thermal activation process. The activation energy (Ea) for C6Li is obtained as 270(5) meV{,} while Ea = 170(20) meV for C12Li. Assuming a jump diffusion of Li+ in the Li layer of C6Li and C12Li{,} a self-diffusion coefficient DLi at 310 K was estimated as 7.6(3) × 10−11 (cm2 s−1) in C6Li and 14.6(4) × 10−11 (cm2 s−1) in C12Li."

   abstract = "The lithium diffusion in graphite anode, which is the most widely used commercial electrode material today, affects the charge/discharge performance of lithium-ion batteries. In this study, the anisotropic strain effects on lithium diffusion in graphite anodes are systematically investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals corrections. It is found that the effects of external applied strains along various directions of LixC6 (i.e., perpendicular or parallel to the basal planes of the graphite host) on lithium diffusivity are different. Along the direction perpendicular to the graphite planes, the tensile strain facilitates in-plane Li diffusion by reducing the energy barrier, and the compressive strain hinders in-plane Li diffusion by raising the energy barrier. In contrast, the in-plane biaxial tensile strain (parallel to the graphite planes) hinders in-plane Li diffusion, and the in-plane biaxial compressive strain facilitates in-plane Li diffusion. Furthermore, both in-plane and transverse shear strains slightly influence Li diffusion in graphite anodes. A discussion is presented to explain the anisotropic strain dependence of lithium diffusion. This research provides data for the continuum modelling of the electrodes in the lithium-ion batteries."

   abstract = {Many carbon allotropes can act as host materials for reversible lithium uptake1,2, thereby laying the foundations for existing and future electrochemical energy storage. However, insight into how lithium is arranged within these hosts is difficult to obtain from a working system. For example, the use of in situ transmission electron microscopy3–5 to probe light elements (especially lithium)6,7 is severely hampered by their low scattering cross-section for impinging electrons and their susceptibility to knock-on damage8. Here we study the reversible intercalation of lithium into bilayer graphene by in situ low-voltage transmission electron microscopy, using both spherical and chromatic aberration correction9 to enhance contrast and resolution to the required levels. The microscopy is supported by electron energy-loss spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. On their remote insertion from an electrochemical cell covering one end of the long but narrow bilayer, we observe lithium atoms to assume multi-layered close-packed order between the two carbon sheets. The lithium storage capacity associated with this superdense phase far exceeds that expected from formation of LiC6, which is the densest configuration known under normal conditions for lithium intercalation within bulk graphitic carbon10. Our findings thus point to the possible existence of distinct storage arrangements of ions in two-dimensional layered materials as compared to their bulk parent compounds.},

   abstract = {Recently published structural analysis and galvanomagnetic studies of a large number of different bulk and mesoscopic graphite samples of high quality and purity reveal that the common picture assuming graphite samples as a semimetal with a homogeneous carrier density of conduction electrons is misleading. These new studies indicate that the main electrical conduction path occurs within 2D interfaces embedded in semiconducting Bernal and/or rhombohedral stacking regions. This new knowledge incites us to revise experimentally and theoretically the diamagnetism of graphite samples. We found that the c-axis susceptibility of highly pure oriented graphite samples is not really constant, but can vary several tens of percent for bulk samples with thickness     t ≳ 30     \&mu;m, whereas by a much larger factor for samples with a smaller thickness. The observed decrease of the susceptibility with sample thickness qualitatively resembles the one reported for the electrical conductivity and indicates that the main part of the c-axis diamagnetic signal is not intrinsic to the ideal graphite structure, but it is due to the highly conducting 2D interfaces. The interpretation of the main diamagnetic signal of graphite agrees with the reported description of its galvanomagnetic properties and provides a hint to understand some magnetic peculiarities of thin graphite samples.},

We clarify that lithium atoms can be stored only in the graphene interlayer and propose the first ever planar lithium-intercalation model for graphenic carbons. Corroborated by theoretical calculations, various physiochemical characterizations of the staged lithium bilayer graphene products further reveal the regular lithium-intercalation phenomena and thus fully illustrate this elementary lithium storage pattern of two-dimension. These findings not only make the commercial graphite the first electrode with clear lithium-storage process, but also guide the development of graphene materials in lithium ion batteries.",
