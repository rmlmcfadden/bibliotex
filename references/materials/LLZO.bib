   abstract = "We have successfully synthesized a high-purity polycrystalline sample of tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12. Single crystals have been also grown by a flux method. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis verifies that tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 has the garnet-related type structure with a space group of I41/acd (no. 142). The lattice constants are a=13.134(4)Å and c=12.663(8)Å. The garnet-type framework structure is composed of two types of dodecahedral LaO8 and octahedral ZrO6. Li atoms occupy three crystallographic sites in the interstices of this framework structure, where Li(1), Li(2), and Li(3) atoms are located at the tetrahedral 8a site and the distorted octahedral 16f and 32g sites, respectively. The structure is also investigated by the Rietveld method with X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data. These diffraction patterns are identified as the tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 structure determined from the single-crystal data. The present tetragonal Li7La3Zr2O12 sample exhibits a bulk Li-ion conductivity of σb=1.63×10−6Scm−1 and grain-boundary Li-ion conductivity of σgb=5.59×10−7Scm−1 at 300K. The activation energy is estimated to be Ea=0.54eV in the temperature range of 300–560K."

   abstract = "The solid lithium-ion electrolyte “Li7La3Zr2O12” (LLZO) with a garnet-type structure has been prepared in the cubic and tetragonal modification following conventional ceramic syntheses routes. Without aluminium doping tetragonal LLZO was obtained, which shows a two orders of magnitude lower room temperature conductivity than the cubic modification. Small concentrations of Al in the order of 1 wt\% were sufficient to stabilize the cubic phase, which is known as a fast lithium-ion conductor. The structure and ion dynamics of Al-doped cubic LLZO were studied by impedance spectroscopy, dc conductivity measurements, 6Li and 7Li NMR, XRD, neutron powder diffraction, and TEM precession electron diffraction. From the results we conclude that aluminium is incorporated in the garnet lattice on the tetrahedral 24dLi site, thus stabilizing the cubic LLZO modification. Simulations based on diffraction data show that even at the low temperature of 4 K the Li ions are blurred over various crystallographic sites. This strong Li ion disorder in cubic Al-stabilized LLZO contributes to the high conductivity observed. The Li jump rates and the activation energy probed by NMR are in very good agreement with the transport parameters obtained from electrical conductivity measurements. The activation energy Ea characterizing long-range ion transport in the Al-stabilized cubic LLZO amounts to 0.34 eV. Total electric conductivities determined by ac impedance and a four point dc technique also agree very well and range from 1 × 10−4 Scm−1 to 4 × 10−4 Scm−1 depending on the Al content of the samples. The room temperature conductivity of Al-free tetragonal LLZO is about two orders of magnitude lower (2 × 10−6 Scm−1, Ea = 0.49 eV activation energy). The electronic partial conductivity of cubic LLZO was measured using the Hebb–Wagner polarization technique. The electronic transference number te− is of the order of 10−7. Thus, cubic LLZO is an almost exclusive lithium ion conductor at ambient temperature."

   abstract = "Lithium-ion dynamics in the garnet-type solid electrolyte “Li7La3Zr2O12” (LLZ) crystallizing with cubic symmetry was probed by means of variable-temperature 7Li NMR spectroscopy and ac impedance measurements. Li jump rates of an Al-containing sample follow Arrhenius behaviour being characterized by a relatively high activation energy of 0.54(3) eV and a pre-exponential factor of 2.2(5) × 1013 s-1. The results resemble those which were quite recently obtained for an Al-free LLZ sample crystallizing, however, with tetragonal symmetry. Hence, most likely, the significantly higher Li conductivity previously reported for a cubic LLZ sample cannot be ascribed solely to the slight structural distortions accompanying the change of the crystal symmetry. Here, even Al impurities, acting as stabilizer for the cubic polymorph at room temperature, do not lead to the high ion conductivity reported previously.",
