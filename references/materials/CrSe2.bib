   abstract = "CrSe2 was prepared by oxidation of KCrSe2 with I2 in acetonitrile at ambient temperature. It has the Cd(OH)2 structure with a = 3.399, c = 5.915 Å at 300 K; the compound is metastable and transforms into Cr2Se3 and Se around 600 K. Between ≈ 180 and ≈ 160 K a (reversible) phase transition occurs with an abrupt decrease of ≈ 1\% of the c-axis and the appearance of some weak reflections. This paper reports the first physical properties obtained on powders and compacts by X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, transport (resistivity, Hall effect, thermoelectric power) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. These data, especially the lattice parameters, show a remarkable behaviour with temperature and suggest that CrSe2 has itinerant d electrons."

The total magnetic moment of  on Cr consists of  in spin-up and  in spin-down states; the total number of 3d electrons on Cr is 4.12, much greater than expected for Cr(IV) . The Cr 3d-based bands overlap the selenium 4p-based valence band which implies strong covalency of the Cr - Se bonding. At the Fermi level there are electrons and holes with Cr 3d character, and holes with Se 4p character. The results clearly indicate the reduction of the cations and the presence of holes in the Se 4p valence band.  is a magnetic metal. Similar calculations for  showed a very small energy difference between the magnetic and non-magnetic states, indicating that  is a non-magnetic metal.}

   abstract = { Physical properties of new S = 3/2 triangular-lattice compounds LiCrSe2, LiCrTe2, and NaCrTe2 have been investigated by X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements. These compounds crystallize in the ordered NiAs-type structure, where alkali metal ions and Cr atoms stack alternately. Despite their isomorphic structures, magnetic properties of these three compounds are different; NaCrTe2 has an A-type spin structure with ferromagnetic layers, LiCrTe2 is likely to exhibit a helical spin structure, and LiCrSe2 shows a first-order-like phase transition from the paramagnetic trigonal phase to the antiferromagnetic monoclinic phase. In these compounds and the other chromium chalcogenides with a triangular lattice, we found a general relationship between the Curie–Weiss temperature and magnetic structures. This relation indicates that the competition between the antiferromagnetic direct d-d exchange interaction and the ferromagnetic superexchange interaction plays an important role in determining the ground state of chromium chalcogenides.}

   abstract = {Anomalous successive structural transitions in layered 1T-CrSe2 with an unusual Cr4+ valency were investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction. 1T-CrSe2 exhibits dramatic structural changes in in-plane Cr–Cr and interlayer Se–Se distances, which originate from two interactions: (i) in-plane Cr–Cr interactions derived from Peierls-like trimerization instabilities on the orbitally assisted one-dimensional chains and (ii) interlayer Se–Se interactions through p–p hybridization. As a result, 1T-CrSe2 has the unexpected ground state of an antiferromagnetic metal with multiple Cr linear trimers with three-center–two-electron σ bonds. Interestingly, partial substitution of Se for S atoms in 1T-CrSe2 changes the ground state from an antiferromagnetic metal to an insulator without long-range magnetic ordering, which is due to the weakening of interlayer interactions between anions. The unique low-temperature structures and electronic states of this system are determined by the competition and cooperation of in-plane Cr–Cr and interlayer Se–Se interactions.}
