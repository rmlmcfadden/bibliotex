   abstract = {The long-range and short-range motion of lithium ions into an electrochemically intercalated Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3 (LLTO) sintered pellet has been studied by ac impedance spectroscopy and 7Li solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The temperature dependence of the dc conductivity and the intercalation ratio dependence of the chemical shift, the relative intensity of the resonance line, the spin-lattice and the spin-spin relaxation times of 7Li NMR experiments are indicative of polaron formation at the initial stage of intercalation. The total dc conductivity measured in the temperature range 45-600 K and the shape of the impedance diagrams show that after intercalation the conductivity is both ionic and electronic in nature. However for temperatures lower than 300 K the total conductivity is mainly dominated by the electronic one and for temperatures higher than 400 K the total conductivity is dominated by the ionic one. Moreover at low temperatures, when electronic conductivity dominates, the temperature dependence of the conductivity agrees well with a polaron model for conduction in these intercalated oxides. The NMR experiments clearly show that the resonance peak decreases strongly as intercalation occurs. This is explained by a coupling between the electronic and the Li+ nuclear spins leading to an unobservability of some Li+ nuclei in NMR. The other Li+ nuclei, which do not interact directly with the electronic spins, are responsible for the observed NMR signal. If the static effect of the intercalation is weak and leads to a very small chemical shift variation, variable temperature 7Li NMR spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation measurements show that the presence of electrons acts essentially on the dynamics of the Li+ nuclei through the lattice modification induced by the polaron formation. At the beginning of the intercalation the inverse of the relaxation time T1 of the observed Li+ nuclei decreases by one order of magnitude. At the same time the linewidth of the resonance peak (1/T2) decreases abruptly. The motion of the lithium ions is sharply enhanced. For further intercalation, 1/T1 decreases and the linewidth of the central peak increases indicating that the variations of the relaxation times are mostly governed by the variations of the spectral densities of the Li+ motion. Consequently, the lithium motion decreases gradually as intercalation proceeds. These results are in good agreement with a lattice modification due to polaron formation during intercalation.}

   abstract = {7Li nuclear magnetic resonance  relaxation times T1, T1ρ and T2 versus temperature are reported in the 150-900 K temperature range for the lithium lanthanum titanate Li3xLa2/3-x□1/3-2xTiO3 perovskite-type fast-ionic conductors.  The presence of Li+ ions of two kinds with slightly differing environments is displayed in these experiments.  These ions exhibit two different motions: a fast one with a characteristic frequency around 100 MHz at 350 K and a slow one whose frequency is around 60 kHz at 280 K. These two different Li+ species cannot be differentiated by means of the fast motion (only one T1 is observed from the experiments), but only by means of the slow ones (two T1ρ and two T2 are observed).  These motions are respectively attributed to Li+ motion inside the A-cage of the perovskite structure formed by the oxygen ions and to Li+ hops between the cages.  T1- and T1ρ-studies also performed on the 6Li nucleus clearly show that just dipolar nuclear interaction is responsible for Li+ relaxation.  This result is at variance with what has been previously put forward for the relaxation process in these compounds.}

Two characteristic frequencies of Li+ motions are evidenced in these compounds: the first is in the range of the Larmor frequency when the second one is in the range of the radio-frequency field. These frequencies are respectively attributed to motion of the Li+ ion inside the cage formed by the oxygen ions and to jumps between the cages. The T1 and T1ρ studies on 6Li nuclei confirm the above results and show that the relaxation is not due to quadrupolar interaction at a variance, which is generally accepted."

   abstract = {To date, the highest bulk lithium ion-conducting solid electrolyte is the perovskite (ABO3)-type lithium lanthanum titanate (LLT) Li3xLa(2/3)-x□(1/3)-2xTiO3 (0 < x < 0.16) and its related structure materials. The x ≈ 0.1 member exhibits conductivity of 1 × 10-3 S/cm at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.40 eV. The conductivity is comparable to that of commonly used polymer/liquid electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of LLT mainly depends on the size of the A-site ion cation (e.g., La or rare earth, alkali or alkaline earth), lithium and vacancy concentration, and the nature of the B−O bond. For example, replacement of La by other rare earth elements with smaller ionic radii than that of La decreases the lithium ion conductivity, while partial substitution of La by Sr (larger ionic radii than that of La) slightly increases the lithium ion conductivity. The high lithium ion conductivity of LLT is considered to be due to the large concentration of A-site vacancies, and the motion of lithium by a vacancy mechanism through the wide square planar bottleneck between the A sites. It is considered that BO6/TiO6 octahedra tilting facilitate the lithium ion mobility in the perovskite structure. The actual mechanism of lithium ion conduction is not yet clearly understood. In this paper, we review the structural properties, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical characterization of LLT and its related materials.}

   abstract = {Microscopic motions of Li+ ions in the fast ionic conductor Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3 (x = 0.09) are studied by dielectric spectroscopy in the frequency range from 103 to 4 × 109 Hz and in the temperature range from 200 to 400 K. Several dielectric relaxations are evidenced by this technique and can be ascribed to different motions of the Li+ ions in the oxide. These motions are related to the Li+ motions observed by means of 7Li NMR and dc conductivity and already reported in previous papers. From these two complementary techniques, three motions of Li+ ions are evidenced in the perovskite structure ABO3: a slow motion that corresponds to the hopping of the Li+ ions from one A-cage to the next vacant one through bottlenecks made of four oxygen ions and two fast motions that correspond to local motions of the mobile ions between their off-centred positions in the A-cage of the perovskite structure. A change in the mechanism of conduction is observed around 200 K. This change is attributed to a change in the dimensionality of the Li+ ion motion from 2D to 3D as temperature is increased. At low temperatures (T<200 K) both the local and the long range Li+ ion motions happen in the (a,b) planes of the crystallographic structure (2D motion). As temperature increases, Li+ ions experience the entire volume of the A-cage finally moving in three directions above 400 K (3D motion). This change is corroborated by the ratio of the activation energies in the two domains, i.e. 1.5, observed in T1 versus 103/T plots as well as in the dc conductivity plot and in the dielectric relaxations versus 103/T plot. These results confirm the fact that, in Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3, the long range motion of Li+ ions is evidenced by T1ρ and σdc and their local motions in the A-site of the perovskite structure are evidenced by T1 and by dielectric spectroscopy at frequencies higher than 1 MHz, in the temperature range investigated. Therefore, T1ρ and σdc can be compared since they are related to the same ionic motion. Finally, we found that the constant loss behaviour, observed by previous authors, is in fact the contribution of two quasi-Debye dielectric relaxations.}

Among the lithium electrolyte ceramics, the lithium lanthanum titanates, Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3, a disordered oxide with perovskite structure, have attracted much attention because of their high conductivity, of the order of 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, for x=0.11. The crystallographic structure of the solid solution, prepared by conventional solid-state chemistry, will be described. The dynamics of the lithium ions in Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3 has been investigated by conductivity spectroscopy in the wide frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 GHz and by 7Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation measurements (T1 and T1ρ) in the temperature range from 150 K to 600 K. Furthermore, the preparation of nanomaterials (20–30 nm) by a modified Pechini-type in-situ polymerizable method will be presented. Finally, we will show the ability of the ceramic to be used as pH sensor."

The a-axis and c-axis oriented films were selectively grown by choosing the substrates. Ionic conductivity at room temperature of LLT epitaxial film on NdGaO3 (110) substrate was close to that of bulk previously reported, representing the highly crystalline quality. In addition, the unequally strained lattice due to different in-plane lattice constants of orthorhombic NdGaO3 substrate resulted in laterally anisotropic ionic conductivity with different activation energy perpendicular to NdGaO3 [11̅0] and [001], 6.7 × 10–4 S·cm–1 with 0.34 eV and 4.3 × 10–4 S·cm–1 with 0.36 eV, respectively.

This review is focused on structural characteristics, Li-ion diffusion behavior and conductivity in LLTO. Li-ion concentration, cooling rate of heat treatment and heating temperature are shown to be three main factors influencing the space group structure of LLTO, involving the distributions of Li, La ions and vacancies as well as the distortion of TiO6 octahedron. In rhombohedral and some orthorhombic phases, Li ions partially occupy O4 windows of cuboctahedrons, whose diffusion could be described by the bond percolation model, whereas in other phases with Li ions inside the cuboctahedrons, the site percolation model is applicable to Li-ion conduction. Li-ion conductivity versus temperature curve exhibits non-Arrhenius behavior, which is divided into three sections with different activation energies, although its first-derivative is continuous. The activation energy is correlated closely with the tilting angle of TiO6 octahedron, both of which decrease with the increase of temperature. Experimental studies and theoretical results are discussed in parallel to provide insight into the detailed structure-conductivity relationship.}
