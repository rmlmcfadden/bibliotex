    abstract = {Abstract The interactions of ionic liquids (IL) with solvents usually used in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are studied. The 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shift values of 1-n-butyl-3-methyl (BM)- and 1-ethyl-3-methyl (EM)-substituted imidazolium (IM) -chlorides (Cl) and -acetates (Ac) are determined before and after diluting with deuterated solvents (DMSO-d6, D2O, CD3OD, and CDCl3). The dilution offers structural modifications of the IL due to the solvents capacity to ionization. For further investigation of highly viscous cellulose dopes made of imidazolium-based IL, solid-state NMR spectroscopy enables the reproducibility of liquid-state NMR data of pure IL. The correlation of liquid- and solid-state NMR is shown on EMIM-Ac and cellulose/EMIM-Ac dope (10 wt \%).},
