    abstract = {Static dielectric constant is a key parameter to estimate the electro-viscous effect which plays important roles in the flow and convective heat transfer of fluids with ions in microfluidic devices such as micro reactors and heat exchangers. A group contribution method based on 27 groups is developed for the correlation of static dielectric constant of ionic liquids in this paper. The ionic liquids considered include imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, alkylammonium, alkylsulfonium, morpholinium and piperidinium cations and various anions. The data collected cover the temperature ranges of 278.15–343.15 K and static dielectric constant ranges of 9.4–85.6. The results of the method show a satisfactory agreement with the literature data with an average absolute relative deviation of 7.41\%, which is generally of the same order of the experimental data accuracy. The method proposed in this paper provides a simple but reliable approach for the prediction of static dielectric constant of ionic liquids at different temperatures.}
