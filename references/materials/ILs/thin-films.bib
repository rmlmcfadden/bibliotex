    abstract = {The role that interfaces play in the dynamics of liquids is a fundamental scientific problem with vast importance in technological applications. From material science to biology, e.g., batteries to cell membranes, liquid properties at interfaces are frequently determinant in the nature of chemical processes. For most liquids, like water, the influence of an interface falls off on a ∼1 nm distance scale. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are a vast class of unusual liquids composed of complex cations and anions that are liquid salts at room temperature. They are unusual liquids with properties that can be finely tuned by selecting the structure of the cation and anion. RTILs are being used or developed in applications such as batteries, CO2 capture, and liquids for biological processes. Here, it is demonstrated quantitatively that the influence of an interface on RTIL properties is profoundly different from that observed in other classes of liquids. The dynamics of planar thin films of the room temperature ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BmimNTf2), were investigated using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) with the CN stretch of SeCN– as the vibrational probe. The structural dynamics (spectral diffusion) of the thin films with controlled nanometer thicknesses were measured and compared to the dynamics of the bulk liquid. The samples were prepared by spin coating the RTIL, together with the vibrational probe, onto a surface functionalized with an ionic monolayer that mimics the structure of the BmimNTf2. Near-Brewster’s angle reflection pump–probe geometry 2D IR facilitated the detection of the exceedingly small signals from the films, some of which were only 14 nm thick. Even in quarter micron (250 nm) thick films, the observed dynamics were much slower than those of the bulk liquid. Using a new theoretical description, the correlation length (exponential falloff of the influence of the interfaces) was found to be 28 ± 5 nm. This very long correlation length, ∼30 times greater than that of water, has major implications for the use of RTILs in devices and other applications.}

    abstract = {Thin film approaches are powerful methods for gaining a nanoscale understanding of interfacial ionic liquids (ILs) in the vicinity of solids. These approaches are used to directly elucidate the interfacial contributions to the physical properties of ILs as nanoscale thin films have significant proportions of the surface or interface region with respect to their total volume. Here, we report the growth of a uniform [emim][TFSA] thin film ionic liquid on a chemically modified, well-wettable sapphire, thereby allowing the in situ measurement of its ionic conductivity on the nanoscale. We observed the thickness-dependent behavior of the ionic conductivity, which gradually decreased especially when the thickness was less than 10 nm, and found it to be quantitatively analyzed well by using an empirical two-layer model. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the thickness-dependent ionic conductivity originates from the solid-like structuring of the IL near the substrate, reproducing a thickness-dependent ionic conductivity. The MD simulation results suggest that the thickness of the low conductivity region determined in the two-layer model should roughly correspond to the thickness of the solid-like structuring of the IL near the substrate.}
