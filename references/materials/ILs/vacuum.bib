    abstract = "The in situ monitoring of catalysis in Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) is fundamental to the understanding of catalytic processes and the role of RTILs in catalytic turnover; we describe how XPS can be used to give information on both pure RTILs and catalytically-active RTIL-based solutions."
