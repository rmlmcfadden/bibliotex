    abstract = {In this study, a new correlation is proposed for estimating 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquid (IL) viscosities at different temperatures and atmospheric pressure. Since ILs are rather novel, many of their physical properties are still unavailable. Because of this limitation, the aim of this work was to propose a correlation with a new insight and approach, which requires a minimum number of physical properties as input parameters. In addition to minimal dependency on physical properties, further goals in the development of the model were generality, ease-of-use, simplicity and high accuracy. A total of 2073 literature viscosity datapoints at different temperatures for 38 different ILs were used and a correlation was developed which satisfied the above-mentioned goals. The IL viscosity models of Lazz√∫s and Pulgar-Villarroel, and Gardas and Coutinho were compared to the proposed correlation. More reliable results were obtained by the proposed relation in comparison to literature models.}
