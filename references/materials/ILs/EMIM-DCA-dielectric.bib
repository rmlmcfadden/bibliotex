    abstract = {Here, we presented new experimental data of diffusion coefficients of five [Emim, (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium)]-based ionic liquids in water at infinite dilution for temperatures ranging from 303.2 to 323.2K using Taylor dispersion method. The investigated ILs were [Emim][C2N3 (dicyanamide)], [Emim][BF4 (tetrafluoroborate)], [Emim][C2H5SO4 (ethylsulfate)], [Emim][CF3SO3 (trifluoromethanesulfonate)], and [Emim][MDEGSO4 (2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethylsulfate)]. The molar conductivities of these ionic liquids were also measured and the infinite dilution conductances were calculated. The temperature dependency of the present experimental diffusion coefficients of the studied ionic liquids in water at infinite dilution were correlated using three equations; namely, Wilke–Chang, empirical (linear), and Nernst–Haskell equation. The Wilke–Chang equation underestimated the diffusion coefficient. The empirical, a typical linear fit, satisfactory represented the present measurements of all the studied systems. The Nernst–Haskell equation satisfactory predicted the diffusion coefficients of most of the ionic liquids under investigation. The self-diffusion coefficients of the studied ions at infinite dilution were also evaluated and briefly discussed. The present results could be very essential to the assessment of the impact of ionic liquid in the waste water stream since it is the most likely pollution it would contribute to the environment.}

    abstract = {Abstract No solo dancers: The temperature dependence of dielectric spectra suggests that the lower-frequency relaxation dominating the dynamics of imidazolium-based room temperature ionic liquids cannot be solely due to independent rotational diffusion of the cations (see picture), but must also include cooperative motions of the surrounding particles. Dielectric spectra were measured for eight, mostly imidazolium-based, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) over a wide range of frequencies (0.2≤ν/GHz≤89) and temperatures (5≤θ/°C≤ 65). Detailed analysis of the spectra shows that the dominant low frequency process centred at ca. 0.06 to 10 GHz (depending on the salt and the temperature) is better described using a symmetrically broadened Cole–Cole model rather than the asymmetric Cole–Davidson models used previously. Evaluation of the temperature dependence of the static permittivities, effective dipole moments, volumes of rotation, activation energies, and relaxation times derived from the dielectric data indicates that the low frequency process cannot be solely due to rotational diffusion of the dipolar imidazolium cations, as has been thought, but must also include other contributions, probably from cooperative motions. Analysis of the Debye process observed at higher frequencies for these RTILs is not undertaken because it overlaps with even faster processes that lie outside the range of the present instrumentation.},

    abstract = {Experimental air–liquid interfacial tension data and density data are presented for two ionic liquids with the 1-Cn-3-methylimidazolium cation, n = 2 and 4, and the dicyanamide anion. The measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range from (278 to 356) K using the Krüss K100MK2 tensiometer. The accuracy of the surface tension measurements was confirmed by employing the Wilhelmy plate and the du Noüy ring methods in parallel. The combined expanded uncertainty at 0.95 confidence level associated with the Wilhelmy plate method is estimated to be 0.1 mN·m–1. The density data were obtained using a buoyancy method with an estimated expanded uncertainty at 0.95 confidence level of 3·10–4ρ. An analysis of the experimental density data, using a group contribution model, performed for eight ionic liquids with the 1-Cn-3-methylimidazolium cation (n = 2, 4, 6) and tetrafluoroborate and trifluoromethanesulfonate and the dicyanamide anion indicates that the uncertainty arising from impurities present in the sample is dominant. The upper-bound estimate for the overall expanded uncertainty (k = 2) in the density measurements including the uncertainty stemming from impurities in the sample is equal to ± 0.002ρ. The model is capable of providing predictions for pure imidazolium-based ionic liquids with [BF4], [CF3SO3], and [N(CN)2] anions.}
