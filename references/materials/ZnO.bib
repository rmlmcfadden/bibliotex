The results indicate a chemical-shift range of more than 600 ppm for the group II oxides, and a range of oxygen-17 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (e2qQh) from ∼0 (CaO, SrO, BaO) to about 7 MHz (for HgO). The chemical shifts observed for the group IIA oxides are well fitted by an equation of the form δ (ppm, from H2O) = 257r3 (Å3) + 11, where r is the ionic radius of the metal cation. The e2qQh values increase with increasing metal electronegativity and thus decrease on descending group IIA, but increase on descending group IIB."

The spectra yield nuclear quadrupole coupling constants and chemical-shift parameters for polycrystalline ZnO and Zns in the wurtzite (hexagonal) form, and chemical shifts and linewidths for polycrystalline ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe in the sphalerite (cubic) form. A single crystal of ZnO is used to obtain an accurate measurement of the quadrupole coupling constant for 67Zn, ∣e2qQ/h∣ = 2.4065(15) MHz at 296 K, in agreement with a recent Mössbauer-effect measurement. The electric field gradient of the wurtzite structures is analysed with a simple ionic model, and the results are found to be in semi-quantitative agreement with experiment.},

The isolated dopant substitutional defects (LiZn, NaZn, KZn and AgZn) are found to be rather stable, with at least a 3.4 eV energy barrier to transform to an interstitial site. All of the dopant interstitials (Lii, Nai, Ki and Agi) are fast diffusers. The diffusion of Li interstitial is isotropic, whereas the diffusion of Na, K and Ag interstitials is highly anisotropic.

   journal = {Rep. Prog. Phys.},
   abstract = {In the past ten years we have witnessed a revival of, and subsequent rapid expansion in, the research on zinc oxide (ZnO) as a semiconductor. Being initially considered as a substrate for GaN and related alloys, the availability of high-quality large bulk single crystals, the strong luminescence demonstrated in optically pumped lasers and the prospects of gaining control over its electrical conductivity have led a large number of groups to turn their research for electronic and photonic devices to ZnO in its own right. The high electron mobility, high thermal conductivity, wide and direct band gap and large exciton binding energy make ZnO suitable for a wide range of devices, including transparent thin-film transistors, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and laser diodes that operate in the blue and ultraviolet region of the spectrum. In spite of the recent rapid developments, controlling the electrical conductivity of ZnO has remained a major challenge. While a number of research groups have reported achieving p-type ZnO, there are still problems concerning the reproducibility of the results and the stability of the p-type conductivity. Even the cause of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in as-grown ZnO is still under debate. One approach to address these issues consists of growing high-quality single crystalline bulk and thin films in which the concentrations of impurities and intrinsic defects are controlled. In this review we discuss the status of ZnO as a semiconductor. We first discuss the growth of bulk and epitaxial films, growth conditions and their influence on the incorporation of native defects and impurities. We then present the theory of doping and native defects in ZnO based on density-functional calculations, discussing the stability and electronic structure of native point defects and impurities and their influence on the electrical conductivity and optical properties of ZnO. We pay special attention to the possible causes of the unintentional n-type conductivity, emphasize the role of impurities, critically review the current status of p-type doping and address possible routes to controlling the electrical conductivity in ZnO. Finally, we discuss band-gap engineering using MgZnO and CdZnO alloys.}

Originally, these centers were treated as Fe3+–Li+ complexes with both ions occupying adjacent cationic sites. Recently, however, the centers were interpreted as a substitutional Fe3+ ion with a vacancy at an adjacent zinc or oxygen site (Fe-VZn or Fe-VO). In order to determine the chemical nature of the impurity associated with Fe3+, electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy was used. ENDOR measurements reveal NMR transitions corresponding to nuclei with g-factor gN=2.171 and spin I=3/2. This unambiguously shows presence of Li as a charge compensator and also resolves contradictions with the theoretical prediction of the Fe-VO formation energy. The electric field gradients at the 7Li nuclei (within the Fe3+–Li+ complexes) were estimated to be significantly lower than the gradient at undistorted Zn sites."
