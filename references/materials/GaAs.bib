   abstract = "A review of recent theories of excitons in magnetic fields in cubic, semi-conductors is given. The valence band degeneracy and anisotropy and the exchange interaction which are taken into account in these theories create a number of typical effects (like an (mj)-dependent diamagnetism) which are verified experimentally in several materials. Consistent sets of band structure parameters are determined from a best fit of magneto-reflection results to the high field theory. A proper interpretation of the reflection experiments demands a correct line shape analysis, including the effects of an exponentially decreasing exciton free surface layer and spatial dispersion: The polariton picture has to be used. The anisotropic compression of the exciton wavefunction in high magnetic fields is directly observed via the anisotropic reduction of the exciton free surface layer. A strong increase of the oscillator strength and of the exchange interaction is another consequence of this compression. The enhanced long range part of the exchange interaction and the Magneto-Stark-Effect could explain the recently observed dependence of the transverse exciton energies on the direction of the magnetic field.",

   abstract = { The out-of-plane g-factor g⊥* for quasi two-dimensional (2D) holes in a (100) GaAs heterostructure is studied using a variable width quantum wire. A direct measurement of the Zeeman splitting is performed in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the 2D plane. We measure an out-of-plane g-factor up to g⊥* = 5, which is larger than previous optical studies of g⊥* and is approaching the long predicted but never experimentally verified out-of-plane g-factor of 7.2 for heavy holes. }
