	% abstract = {Mechanical relaxation measurements are used extensively to obtain information on the diffusion rate of interstitial solute atoms in body‐centered cubic metals. Such studies have been stimulated by a model, developed by J. L. Snoek, which yielded a relationship between a relaxation time, an experimental parameter, and the diffusion coefficient of the solute atom. Although Snoek's model was confirmed very well for solid solutions of carbon or nitrogen in α‐iron, a number of anomalies were observed when relaxation studies were extended to the group V transition metals.An extensive experimental study has been made of the factors that influence relaxation times. The anomalous behavior of the group VA metals can be accommodated within the framework of Snoek's model by taking account of the specific nature of solid solutions based on these metals.Diffusion data obtained by a variety of relaxation techniques are presented for oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon in vanadium, niobium (columbium), and tantalum. These data are in agreement with those obtained by the more conventional concentration gradient techniques in the few instances where such information is available. The pattern of activation energies suggest that lattice strain considerations alone are insufficient to explain the activation process involved in interstitial diffusion.},

	% abstract = {Elastic after-effect and low frequency internal friction measurements have been made on niobiumoxygen alloys containing oxygen in solid solution in the range 0.1–1.5 at. %. The data are analyzed into either three or four distinct relaxation processes, depending upon the oxygen concentration. The rate parameters, τio and ΔHi, and the variation of the component relaxation strengths, Ai, with temperature and oxygen concentration are determined for these processes. A comparison of these results with information from other investigations suggests that the relaxation spectrum involves the stress-induced ordering of single, unassociated oxygen atoms (the Snoek effect) and the relaxation of small (two-to-four atom) oxygen clusters.}

The peak temperatures were determined using a new numerical analysis of the peak shape. These new low temperature data have been combined with high temperature direct data and intermediate temperature high frequency internal friction data reported in the literature. When it is assumed that the oxygen and nitrogen] occupied octahedral positions in the niobium matrix, the diffusion coefficients for both oxygen and nitrogen atoms follow a simple Arrhenius behavior. In the temperature range of this analysis (140 to 1000{\textdegree}C for oxygen and 270 to 1800{\textdegree}C for nitrogen) the equationsD = (5.3E - 7) exp - (1.095E5)/RT andD = (2.6E - 6) exp - (1.523E5)/RT apply for the diffusion of oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. Entropy of activation calculations were made using the above activation energies and frequency factors, and the results agree well with reported values for other systems as well as with the theory of Keyes. This good agreement suggests that the assumption that oxygen and nitrogen prefer octahedral sites is probably correct.",

The temperature dependence of the oxygen diffusivity in pure niobum is D = 4.55 × 10−3exp (−25900RT) cm2s−1. Oxygen additions to the niobium (≤1.5 at.% O) did not significantly affect the oxygen diffusivity. As the zirconium content of the niobium increased the oxygen diffusivity decreased. As zirconium atoms are dissolved substitutionally onto the niobium lattice, they form trapping sites at which OZr clusters may be formed. The binding entropy, AS of the clusters was determined to be about −3.3 k e.u.}

	% abstract = {The free energy of solution of interstitial atoms is rather different in metals of different groups of the periodic table and, therefore, the equilibrium concentration ratio of the interstitials in a metal I/metal II couple reaches several orders of magnitude. Thus one of the metals becomes a sink while the other acts as a barrier. Some experimental procedures were discussed which allow determination of diffusion coefficient D and the diffusivity-solubility product Dcs. The methods described were applied to the oxygen systems of Cu, Nb and Ta where the following results were obtained: Nb-O D0 = 1.7(± 0.2) · 10−6 m2/s (T = 600–1100°C) Q = 108(± 1) kJ/mole Ta-O D0 = 3.5(± 0.3) · 10−7 m2/s (T = 600–1600°C) Q = 99.3(± 0.7) kJ/moleCu−O Dcs = 4.2(−1.3+1.7)·10−6exp(−21,200±200T)Do = 5.8(−4.3+15.7·10−7m2/s (T = 600–1000°CQ = 57.4(±11.6)kJ/mole.

In the entire temperature range the Zeeman NSR rate 1/T1 is determined by fluctuations of the conduction electron-nucleus interaction. The rotating frame NSR rates 1/T1ϱ, however, exhibit three distinct maxima at elevated temperatures, in addition to the conduction electron induced contribution. These NSR peaks are shown to be caused by fluctuations of the nuclear quadrupole interaction of the probe nuclei due to migration of interstitial oxygen atoms. From the experimental data the corresponding activation energies Ea and pre-exponential factors τ0 for the respective oxygen jump rates have been determined. We found that the atomic jump rates differ in τ0 basically, while the activation energies are nearly identical for all three relaxation mechanisms (≈ 1eV). The results are discussed in the framework of three existing models for the diffusion of interstitial impurities in metals.}

The surface crystallographic orientation was shown to influence oxide surface structure; Nb(111) displayed disordered surface oxide domains while Nb(100) was comprised of well-ordered, (n × 1)-O domains. The temperature-dependent dissolution of the native oxide layer on Nb(100) was characterized to ascertain the energetics for oxygen dissolution, and evolution of the surface oxide superlattice structure following thermal annealing was observed with STM. By understanding the kinetic behavior of oxygen dissolution during thermal annealing and subsequent structural evolution of the Nb(n × 1)-O superlattice on Nb(100), a more thorough understanding of the complex interactions driving chemical composition and cavity surface structure under Nb SRF cavity processing and operating conditions may be understood.}
