    abstract = {The Nb films with thickness from several tens to 500 Å were grown by means of a special evaporation source (NbEBES) on (0001) alumina substrates in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The quality of the substrate surface and epitaxial parameters of the Nb over layers were examined by Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). The two epitaxial orientations of Nb film with respect to the (0001) surface plane of alumina substrate were observed in the dependence of the substrate temperature during the Nb deposition. In the range between 250 and 400°C the (110) epitaxial orientation was found. For the substrate temperature higher than 400°C the (111) epitaxial orientation took place. Also the influence of the substrate temperature on the surface roughness of the resulted Nb film was studied. Very low evaporation rate (several Å/min) at the substrate temperature range between 350 and 400°C produced a relatively smooth surface of the Nb thin film with the (110) epitaxial orientation.}

    abstract = {A review of the experimental and theoretical work on the growth and structure of epitaxial niobium on sapphire is presented. The review focuses on growth methods by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputtering techniques. The experimental results come from a broad spectrum of techniques, including electron microscopy, electron and X-ray diffraction, and surface microscopy. Theoretical studies provide models for the structure of the Nb–Al2O3 interface and the nature and distribution of misfit dislocations. The results from growth of niobium on a number of sapphire surface planes are critically discussed and analysed, from the first stages of growth to the ensemble structure and as functions of the substrate. The resulting film characteristics are discussed as a function of substrate quality and temperature and of film thickness. The discussion attempts to define some outstanding questions that must be answered to fully understand this system.}

From a comparison of the measured vortex profiles with theoretical models, as a function of scan height, we conclude that it is possible to determine the relative value of the magnetic penetration depth λ to within 10-20\% using an uncalibrated tip. If a quantitatively characterized tip with a known magnetization structure were used, this would then permit one to obtain an absolute value of λ with similar accuracy.}

The width of the superconducting-to-normal transition for all films is remarkably narrow, confirming their high quality. The superconducting critical current density exhibits a pronounced maximum for thickness around 25{\thinspace}nm, marking the 3D-to-2D crossover. The magnetic penetration depth shows a sizeable enhancement for the thinnest films. Additional amplification effects of the superconducting properties have been obtained with sapphire substrates or squeezing the lateral size of the nanofilms. For thickness close to 20{\thinspace}nm we measured a doubled perpendicular critical magnetic field compared to its large thickness value, indicating shortening of the correlation length and the formation of small Cooper pairs. Our data analysis indicates an exciting interplay between quantum-size and proximity effects together with strong-coupling effects and the importance of disorder in the thinnest films, placing these nanofilms close to the BCS-BEC crossover regime.",
