Whereas at 300 K the oxidation of Nb in H2O saturates at 6 nm Nb2O5 in some minutes, the oxidation in dry O2 is slowly reaching 6 nm Nb2O5 only after some days. The slowness of this growth results in the separation of the following steps in the oxide growth on Nb: (a) Rapid growth of about 0.5 nm interface oxide NbOx (x ≈1). (b) Slow, logarithmic growth of Nb2O5 (∫ ln(tpo2 + 1)), which becomes more rapid with O2 pressure, (c) Depending on the oxidation conditions the — logarithmic — growth becomes more rapid above 2 nm Nb2O5. (d) Above 6 nm the rapid Nb2O5 growth is levelling off and changing to the slow, thermally activated diffusion. This Nb2O5 growth can be explained by an O2 pressure dependent Cabrera-Mott process up to 6 nm. The saturation thickness of 6 nm is given by the diminishing electron tunnel probability through the Nb2O5 layer.}

During these measurements, the competing processes of oxidation (due to a fraction of the surface collisions reacting) and reduction (due to surface oxygen dissolving into the bulk) established a steady state balance. Once at steady state, the sticking coefficients were calculated by dividing the rate of oxygen collisions with the surface (i.e. pressure) into the previously determined rate of oxygen dissolution. This technique proved capable of measuring reactive sticking coefficients on the order of 10−4. The activation energy for oxygen reaction at the niobium oxide surface was found to be 184±7 kJ mol−1. Knowledge of the activation energy for O2 reaction at the surface, and the previously determined values for dissolution into the bulk, permitted estimation of the niobium oxidation rate as a function of surface temperature and O2 pressure.}

During the heating phase, an irreversible transition has been observed near T≅200÷300°C; it is characterized by a progressive reduction of Nb oxides from Nb2O5 to NbO2 and finally to NbO. The O signal disappears near T≅1000°C and it reappears below 900°C, during the cooling phase. This can be interpreted as due to O migration in the Nb matrix, raising T, and to O diffusion towards the surface as the temperature decreases.

Under atmospheric conditions we obtain an unlimited growth of an amorphous Nb2O5 layer, while dry oxidation at 340°C and 10−3 mbar results in the growth of a crystalline and passivating NbO(111) layer with a final thickness of about 50 Å. In addition atmospherically oxidized samples show the formation of an oxygen lattice gas in the remaining Nb(110) film, which is not observed parallel to the growth of NbO during dry oxidation. The use of thin film systems together with x-ray diffraction methods provides a powerful combination to investigate the oxidation process under different conditions down to the atomic scale and thus complements oxidation studies performed in the past.},

We rationalize the well-known puzzle, i.e., Nb(110) is difficult to clean, by calculating the O dissolution, and the on-surface and subsurface adsorption at low concentration. It is found that the structure of on-surface O adsorption at 0.50 monolayer (ML) coverage has the largest binding energy and minimum work function, in agreement with experimental results. At 1.00 ML coverage, the inward diffusion of O atoms is promoted by O adatoms, attributed to the formation of a local electric field. Our theoretical results improve the understanding of the experiments showing that NbOx oxides on the surface can be formed and decomposed by treating samples at 1500–2000 K in vacuum. Furthermore, the thermodynamic analysis of the O/Nb(110) systems shows that bulk NbO is stable in vacuum, in agreement with the observed formation of NbO nanostructures on Nb(110).}

We find the long and short bridge sites to be transition states for O diffusion on Nb(110), while the on-top site is a rank-2 saddle point. In the subsurface region, the oxygen atom prefers the octahedral site, as in bulk niobium. Our results show also that the O atom is more stable on Nb(110) subsurface than on Nb(100) subsurface. The diffusion of oxygen atoms into niobium surfaces passes through transition states where the oxygen atom is coordinated to four niobium atoms. The diffusion barriers of the oxygen atom into Nb(110) and Nb(100) are 1.81 eV and 2.05 eV, respectively. An analysis of the electronic density of states reveals the emergence of well-localized electronic states below the lowest states of clean Nb surfaces due to d--p orbital hybridization.",

	% abstract = {Niobium’s superconducting properties are affected by the presence and precipitation of impurities in the near-surface region. A systematic wide-temperature range x-ray diffraction study is presented addressing the effect of low temperatures (108 K–130 K) and annealing treatments (523 K in nitrogen atmosphere, 400 K in UHV) on the near-surface region of a hydrogen-loaded Nb(100) single-crystal. Under these conditions, the response of the natural surface oxides (Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO) and the changes in the subsurface concentration of interstitial species in Nb are explored, thereby including the cryogenic temperature regime relevant for device operation. The formation and suppression of niobium hydrides in such conditions are also investigated. These treatments are shown to result in: (i) an increase in the concentration of interstitial species (oxygen and nitrogen) occupying the octahedral sites of the Nb bcc lattice at room temperature, both in the near-surface region and in the bulk. (ii) A decrease in the concentration of interstitials within the first 10 nm from the surface at 130 K. (iii) Hydride formation suppression at temperatures as low as 130 K. These results show that mild annealing in nitrogen atmosphere can suppress the formation of superconducting-detrimental niobium hydrides, while subsurface interstitial atoms tend to segregate towards the surface at 130 K, therefore altering the local concentration of impurities within the RF penetration depth of Nb. These processes are discussed in the context of the improvement of niobium superconducting radio-frequency cavities for next-generation particle accelerators.}
