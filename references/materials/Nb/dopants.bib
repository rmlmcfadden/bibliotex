	abstract = "{The critical current density vs applied transverse magnetic field was measured, for a superconducting niobium single crystal of controlled oxygen content, at successively higher levels of concentration; the oxygen content was increased in increments ranging from 2 to 50 ppm, under conditions of constant substructure, from an initial level of approximately 5 ppm to a final level of 360 ppm. The over‐all critical current density increased considerably on the addition of oxygen, and assuming γ to be independent of oxygen concentration, the upper critical field increases in accordance with the predictions of the GLAG theory for type II superconductivity. The critical current density above the upper critical field, which has been ascribed to nucleation effects at defects or surfaces, was also very sensitive to the oxygen content.}",

	abstract = {Surface irreversibility of superconducting niobium is drastically reduced by oxidation. This phenomenon is not caused by the oxide layer on the surface, but by the adjacent diffusion layer. A new method is developed to measure the oxygen profile in thin diffusion layers; the values of the diffusion coefficient are in agreement with those obtained from internal friction measurements. It is demonstrated that for a significant reduction of the irreversibility the diffusion depth should be at least of the order of the effective magnetic penetration depth. An explanation of the effect is given on the basis of the Bean-Livingston model. It is essentially due to the decrease of Hc1 in the diffusion layer.}
