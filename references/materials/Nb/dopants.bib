	abstract = {Surface irreversibility of superconducting niobium is drastically reduced by oxidation. This phenomenon is not caused by the oxide layer on the surface, but by the adjacent diffusion layer. A new method is developed to measure the oxygen profile in thin diffusion layers; the values of the diffusion coefficient are in agreement with those obtained from internal friction measurements. It is demonstrated that for a significant reduction of the irreversibility the diffusion depth should be at least of the order of the effective magnetic penetration depth. An explanation of the effect is given on the basis of the Bean-Livingston model. It is essentially due to the decrease of Hc1 in the diffusion layer.}
