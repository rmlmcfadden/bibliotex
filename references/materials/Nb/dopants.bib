	abstract = "{The critical current density vs applied transverse magnetic field was measured, for a superconducting niobium single crystal of controlled oxygen content, at successively higher levels of concentration; the oxygen content was increased in increments ranging from 2 to 50 ppm, under conditions of constant substructure, from an initial level of approximately 5 ppm to a final level of 360 ppm. The over‐all critical current density increased considerably on the addition of oxygen, and assuming γ to be independent of oxygen concentration, the upper critical field increases in accordance with the predictions of the GLAG theory for type II superconductivity. The critical current density above the upper critical field, which has been ascribed to nucleation effects at defects or surfaces, was also very sensitive to the oxygen content.}",

	abstract = {Auger spectroscopy has been used to investigate the interactions of oxygen and nitrogen with both the (100) face niobium and with polycrystalline niobium. Sticking coefficients for both gases have been determined as a function of coverage. A temperature and concentration ependent segregation of oxygen at the surface has been observed even under conditions where the solid solubility of the bulk was not exceeded. A model to describe this segregation has been developed and extended to explain discrepancies in earlier investigations f the reaction of oxygen with niobium.}

	abstract = {Surface irreversibility of superconducting niobium is drastically reduced by oxidation. This phenomenon is not caused by the oxide layer on the surface, but by the adjacent diffusion layer. A new method is developed to measure the oxygen profile in thin diffusion layers; the values of the diffusion coefficient are in agreement with those obtained from internal friction measurements. It is demonstrated that for a significant reduction of the irreversibility the diffusion depth should be at least of the order of the effective magnetic penetration depth. An explanation of the effect is given on the basis of the Bean-Livingston model. It is essentially due to the decrease of Hc1 in the diffusion layer.}

	% abstract = {Anodic Nb2O5 layers of thickness 100nm on polycrystalline niobium were vacuum annealed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions in the temperature range 325–365°C and for heating times of up to 120 min. The oxygen concentration profiles in the heat-treated layers were determined by Auger electron spectroscopy sputter depth profiling with a rastered beam of 1 keV Ar+ ions. Using such profiles the mechanism of oxide dissolution into the metal substrate is discussed in detail and a distinction is drawn between oxide decomposition and oxygen diffusion as the rate-determining processes. A value of 50 kcal mol−1 is found for the mean activation energy of the dissolution process. The oxygen diffusion coefficients are found to decrease in the sequence α-Nb, NbO, Nb2O5, NbO2. It is shown that homogeneous regions of the suboxides NbO2 and NbO can be prepared by controlled vacuum annealing of Nb2O5.}

	% abstract = {The stabilities of Nb2O5 films occurring on niobium or Nb-1%Zr substrates were examined during ultrahigh vacuum annealing. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the concentration of species present at the surface. The metal-oxide systems investigated showed similar behavior. They did not form stable layers and surface reduction from Nb2O5 to NbO due to dissolution of oxygen into the bulk metal was observed at temperatures above 598 K. The kinetics of this reaction were determined using anodically deposited Nb2O5 overlayers (33 nm thick). Kinetic data were obtained by continuously monitoring the O 1s peak during annealing in the temperature range 623–723 K at base pressures of around 10−8 Pa. The reaction was first order and proceeded with a measured activation energy of 174±6 kJ mol−1 and a frequency factor of 8.9×1010.0±0.3s−1. Similar kinetic data using oxide overlayers 11 and 66 nm thick demonstrated that the dissolution process was independent of initial oxide thickness and controlled by reaction at the oxide-metal interface. The shift of Nb 3d32−52 spectra to lower binding energies during vacuum annealing suggested the following reduction sequence. Continuous monitoring and deconvolution of the Nb 3d32−52 spectra allowed independent rate measurements of each step. The reaction for the Nb5+ to Nb4+ transition was first order and proceeded with a measured activation energy of 134 ±16 kJ mol−1 and a frequency factor of 8.0×107.0±0.4 s−1. The Nb4+ to Nb2+ transition was also first order and the activation energy and the frequency factor were calculated using two different methods. A single-point method, using the maximum concentration of Nb4+, yielded an activation energy of 180±18 kJ mol−1 and a frequency factor of 5.4×1010.0±0.5 s−1. A multi-point method, using all measured Nb4+ concentrations in a computer simulation, yielded an activation energy of 177±16 kJ mol−1 and a frequency factor of 1.0×1011.0±0.4 s−1. These two methods compare favorably with one another and based on the rate constants, the Nb4+ to Nb2+ transition was determined to be the rate-limiting step in the overall reduction. The presence or absence of 1% zirconium did not affect the kinetics of oxygen dissolution during our studies.}
