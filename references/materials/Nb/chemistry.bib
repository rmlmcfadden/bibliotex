	abstract = {Oxidation of niobium at room temperature is not restricted to Nb2O5 growth (about 2 nm) alone, as implied by the negligible oxygen diffusion in bulk niobium. Instead, the strain caused by solution of oxygen in niobium and by growth of Nb2O5 causes Nb6O precipitates at niobium defects and serration of the niobium surface by Nb2O5-microcrystallites. These precipitates and the Nb2O5 crystallites produce compressed and strained niobium regions where in the strained regions further oxygen is injected and thus enhanced inhomogeneous niobium oxidation is promoted. This enhanced oxidation reaching 1 to 10 μm deep in the niobium after 1 h at room temperature has been analysed using angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and using superconducting measurements. These measurements reveal the dependence of enhanced oxidation on the defect concentration of niobium and on the hardness.}

    abstract = {Abstract Niobium, also know as columbium, is used primarily as an alloy addition to steel. Ferroniobium and nickel-niobium are the most frequently used alloys. Niobium is also vital to the formation of superalloys, and its compounds find use in nuclear fuel rods, optical glass, as ferroelectrics, semiconductors, and in superconducting material. Of primary interest is the stability of niobium metals and its alloys to corrosion. The occurrence, extraction, refining and metallurgy of niobium are described. The analytical procedures for determination of niobium and its impurities are discussed. The primary niobium compounds which range from the refractory borides and carbides through ferroelectric salts of niobic acid are discussed.}
