	abstract = "This paper presents a review of the efforts directed to the preparation of ultra-high-purity Nb published during the last 15 years. The interest in high-purity Nb has risen from the need for materials in high temperature and vacuum technology, superconductivity, solid state physics, and its potential in atomic energy fields. Depending on its many applications, the ``purity'' of Nb is understood in different ways. Based on results of known purification processes for Nb (e.g., liquid-liquid extraction of fluorides, distillation of halogenides, electrolysis in molten salts, electron beam float zone refining, electrotransport, and degassing in ultra high vacuum), an optimized method has been developed, consisting of electrolytic refining which results in single crystals, zone melting, and ultra high vacuum treatments. Material produced by the process has maximum impurity concentrations of 10−l ppm Ta, 2{\texttimes}10−3 ppm W, 4{\texttimes}10−6ppm Co, 2{\texttimes}10−3 ppm Fe, 10−5 ppm Cr, etc., with less than 1 ppm interstitials (C,N,O, except H) and a residual electrical resistivity ratio (RRR) of >104. To accurately determine residual impurity levels, improved analytical techniques were developed. Doping of the produced Nb with selected metallic (Cr,Mo,Hf,Ir) and nonmetallic elements (C, 0) on the ppm level served as both a calibration of the analytical techniques and an effort to tailor the physical properties. General aspects for the development of purification processes for refractory metals, sources of contamination during purification, sample preparation, and application of Nb, as well as the limiting bulk and surface purity of reactive metals are presented here.",

	abstract = {Oxidation of niobium at room temperature is not restricted to Nb2O5 growth (about 2 nm) alone, as implied by the negligible oxygen diffusion in bulk niobium. Instead, the strain caused by solution of oxygen in niobium and by growth of Nb2O5 causes Nb6O precipitates at niobium defects and serration of the niobium surface by Nb2O5-microcrystallites. These precipitates and the Nb2O5 crystallites produce compressed and strained niobium regions where in the strained regions further oxygen is injected and thus enhanced inhomogeneous niobium oxidation is promoted. This enhanced oxidation reaching 1 to 10 μm deep in the niobium after 1 h at room temperature has been analysed using angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and using superconducting measurements. These measurements reveal the dependence of enhanced oxidation on the defect concentration of niobium and on the hardness.}

    abstract = {Abstract Niobium, also know as columbium, is used primarily as an alloy addition to steel. Ferroniobium and nickel-niobium are the most frequently used alloys. Niobium is also vital to the formation of superalloys, and its compounds find use in nuclear fuel rods, optical glass, as ferroelectrics, semiconductors, and in superconducting material. Of primary interest is the stability of niobium metals and its alloys to corrosion. The occurrence, extraction, refining and metallurgy of niobium are described. The analytical procedures for determination of niobium and its impurities are discussed. The primary niobium compounds which range from the refractory borides and carbides through ferroelectric salts of niobic acid are discussed.}

	abstract = "The standard preparation of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities made of pure niobium include the removal of a ``damaged'' surface layer, by buffered chemical polishing (BCP) or electropolishing (EP), after the cavities are formed. The performance of the cavities is characterized by a sharp degradation of the quality factor at high surface magnetic field, a phenomenon referred to as ``Q-drop''. In some cases, the Q-drop can be significantly reduced by a low-temperature ({\~}120 {\textdegree}C) ``in situ'' baking of the cavity. As part of the effort to understand this phenomenon, the effect of introducing a polarization potential during BCP, creating a process which is between the standard BCP and EP, was investigated. The focus of this contribution is on the characterization of this novel electrochemical process by measuring polarization curves, etching rates, surface finish, and electrochemical impedance. In particular, it is shown that the anodic potential of Nb during BCP has a plateau region in the polarization curve and the impedance diagrams on the plateau can be described with a ``surface charge'' model found in the literature. By applying an anodic potential to Nb, a lower etching rate and better the surface finish than by standard BCP process have been obtained.",

This review will begin by describing the niobium oxygen system and the different stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric phases, specifically Nb, NbO, NbO2, Nb2O5 and Nb2O5−δ. The crystalline phases and polymorphs of these materials are often inconsistently identified in different works and thus, a clarification of the nomenclature of the several niobium oxides polymorph and their crystalline structure is also presented. Due to their interesting physical properties, many applications of these materials have been suggested such as solid electrolytic capacitors, catalysis, photochromic devices, transparent conductive oxides or memristors, becoming obvious that a good understanding of niobium oxides physical properties and their control is essential and urgent. Additionally, a short review on different types of niobates, namely alkali niobates, columbite niobates and rare earth niobates and the relation of the properties of these materials with niobium oxides will be presented.}
