    abstract = {Abstract Niobium, also know as columbium, is used primarily as an alloy addition to steel. Ferroniobium and nickel-niobium are the most frequently used alloys. Niobium is also vital to the formation of superalloys, and its compounds find use in nuclear fuel rods, optical glass, as ferroelectrics, semiconductors, and in superconducting material. Of primary interest is the stability of niobium metals and its alloys to corrosion. The occurrence, extraction, refining and metallurgy of niobium are described. The analytical procedures for determination of niobium and its impurities are discussed. The primary niobium compounds which range from the refractory borides and carbides through ferroelectric salts of niobic acid are discussed.}
