The method makes use of the strong magnetic field gradients existing in the mixed state of Type-II superconductors and monitorsD$\mu$ through the variation of the magnetic field felt by the $\mu$+ during their diffusion through the crystals. For $\mu$+ near the centres of the flux lines inNb it givesD$\mu$(4.6 K)=(8{\textpm}2){\textperiodcentered}10−11m2S−1. The positive temperature coefficient ofD$\mu$ indicates that at liquid-helium temperatures the diffusivity of $\mu$+ inNb is mainly due to phonon-assisted tunnelling processes.",

More detailed predictions of the positions and intensities of the resonances require numerical simulations taking account of the local geometry of the muon site. We present such simulations for muons adjacent to nuclei of spin 9/2 and demonstrate a pronounced dependence on the anisotropy of the quadrupole coupling tensor. Simulations for the specific cases of muons located at the octahedral and tetrahedral interstices in niobium metal are compared with the experimentally detected spectrum in a polycrystalline sample.",

This is consistent with an increase from the lower critical magnetic field up to the superheating field of the Nb substrate. In the experiments presented here coatings of Nb3Sn and MgB2 with a thickness between 50 and 2000 nm have been tested. does not depend on material or thickness. This suggests that the energy barrier at the boundary between the two materials prevents flux entry up to of the substrate. A mechanism consistent with these findings is that the proximity effect recovers the stability of the energy barrier for flux penetration, which is suppressed by defects for uncoated samples. Additionally, a low temperature baked Nb sample has been tested. Here a 6\% increase of was found, also pushing beyond.}

Degraded surface superconducting properties are found to correlate to lower quality factors and stronger Q-slope. In addition, both techniques find evidence for surface paramagnetism on all samples and particularly on Nb films prepared by HIPIMS.}
