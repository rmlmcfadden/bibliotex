	abstract = {The behaviour of positive muons ( mu +) has been studied in Cu, V, Nb and Ta single crystals, using the muon spin rotation ( mu SR) technique. The measurements were performed in the temperature regime 5-365K, in transverse external magnetic fields of 50-5500 G. In FCC Cu the mu + diffusional motion can be described in terms of quantum mechanical jump processes of a small polaron among octahedral interstitial sites. An orientation average leads to an activation energy of E=79.2+or-3.1 meV, a pre-exponential factor of D(0)=(1.66+or-0.33)*10-8 cm2 s-1 and a tunnelling matrix element of J=(18.3+or-1.8)*10-6 eV. The mu + total volume expansion was found to be Delta V=3.91 AA3. Furthermore, the electric field gradient (EFG) at the mu + nearest-neighbour nuclei has been determined as q=0.30 AA-3. In BCC V, Nb and Ta the mu + diffusion is trap-limited. As a function of the temperature the mu + probe different classes of trapping sites associated with host metal impurities. At low temperature, before decaying, the mu + always end up in a trapped state which shows that the intrinsic mu + motion between traps is fast and seems to reflect properties of a band diffusion.}

	abstract = {We studied the trapping and diffusion behaviour of positive muons (μ+) in niobium single crystals by comparing the measured depolarization rate with model calculations. Zero-field muon spin resonance measurements reveal the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and also clearly indicate that the different trap configurations above and below about 22 K are correlated. The activation energy needed to escape from the low temperature traps was found to be 200 ± 20 K (17 ± 1.5 meV). Subsequently, the angular dependence of the depolarization rate was measured at 14.0 and 36.8 K in a transverse field of 7.47 kG by rotating a niobium single crystal around its 〈110〉 axis, which was kept perpendicular to both the field and the μ+ polarization. This allows the site symmetry of the trapped muon to be determined as well as the lattice distortions around it. The trapping site at 36.8 K could be identified as a tetrahedral site next to a tantalum impurity, and possibly also close to an interstitial (nitrogen or oxygen) impurity. A local lattice relaxation ΔRR of 6.7(6)\% for nearest neighbours and of −(6 ± 2)\% for next-nearest neighbours has been deduced. The low temperature curve shows a much more pronounced angular dependence than the high temperature curve, indicating a completely different μ+ environment. A satisfactory explanation for these data has not yet been found.}

To determine the sites at which the muon is trapped on both sides of this dip, the full angular dependence of the depolarization rate was measured by rotating a large single crystal around its {\textlangle}110{\textrangle} cylinder axis in a transverse magnetic field. The resulting curves for both temperatures are quite different, reflecting clearly the different environment in which the muon is trapped above and below 22 K. The trapping site at 36.8 K was identified to be of tetrahedral symmetry, located near a Ta substitutional impurity and possibly associated with an interstitial impurity. Lattice distortions due to these impurities and radial relaxation around the muon,$\delta$R/R, were determined. The latter is +6.7(6){\%} for nearest neighbors and −6(2){\%} for next nearest neighbors. The 14.0 K angular dependence could not be fitted by considering distorted tetrahedral and octahedral sites and pointlike muons.",

In the experiments presented here coatings of Nb3Sn and MgB2 with a thickness between 50 and 2000 nm have been tested. does not depend on material or thickness. This suggests that the energy barrier at the boundary between the two materials prevents flux entry up to of the substrate.

   abstract = {Point contact tunneling and low energy muon spin rotation are used to probe, on the same samples, the surface superconducting properties of micrometer thick niobium films deposited onto copper substrates using different sputtering techniques: diode, dc magnetron and HIPIMS. The combined results are compared to radio-frequency tests performances of RF cavities made with the same processes. Degraded surface superconducting properties are found to correlate to lower quality factors and stronger Q-slope. In addition, both techniques find evidence for surface paramagnetism on all samples and particularly on Nb films prepared by HIPIMS.}
