	abstract = "We have shown in a previous paper1 how the McMillan2 electron-phonon mass enhancement factor $\lambda$ can be determined from specific heat data. New specific heat measurements for niobium and tantalum that allow $\lambda$ to be determined for these materials are reported in the present paper. The addition of these results to those previously reported1 permits verification of the McMillan theory2 in a large number of transition metals. For scandium, yttrium, niobium, vanadium, and tantalum our results for $\lambda$ agree quite well with the values obtained in the Bennemann and Garland3 extension of the McMillan theory. For platinum and palladium the agreement is satisfactory if strong spin-fluctuation effects are taken into account.",
