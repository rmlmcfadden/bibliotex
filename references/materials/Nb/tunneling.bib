	abstract = "A quantitative proximity electron tunneling spectroscopy (PETS) is demonstrated for the study of strong coupling superconductors which do not form suitable insulating oxides for conventional McMillan-Rowell tunneling spectroscopy. Proximity junctions of the form C-Al2O3-Al/S are employed, with Al thickness dN ≤ 100 ». Here S is the superconductor of interest and C is any convenient counterelectrode. The physical basis for the method, experimental techniques, and data obtained from foils of Nb are presented. The results for Nb include the energy-dependent pair potential $\delta$S(E), the renormalization function Z(E), effective phonon spectrum $\alpha$ 2F($\Omega$), electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$, and Coulomb pseudopotential $\Mu$*. A full discussion of the underlying theory and details of the methods of analysis employed to obtain, in addition, the pair potential of the Al proximity layer are contained in a following paper.",

These methods are applied to the treatment of data on PET junctions of the form In-Al2O3-Al/Nb. Inclusion of the influence of the Nb-induced Al pair potential produces important corrections to Nb properties ($\alpha$2F(E), $\lambda$, $\Mu$*) initially obtained by neglecting this influence.",

	abstract = {New experimental estimates are given of the separate electron-phonon (λph) and paramagnon (λS) contributions to mass renormalization for the transition metals Nb and V, from recent tunneling results. Our analysis, which is the first of its kind, is based on the recent demonstration of Daams, Mitrovic, and Carbotte of a simple rescaling of the Eliashberg equations using an effective coupling parameter λph(1+λS). The results provide a consistent picture of superconductivity in these transition elements from tunneling, in substantially improved agreement with other measurements. We conclude that spin fluctuations reduce the electron-phonon Tc values in Nb and V by 25\% and 45\%, respectively.}

	abstract = {The structure and tunneling behavior of Nb/Al multilayer films is reported. Using similar deposition methods we also show that a few monolayers of Al strongly modifies the oxidation behavior of Nb and the characteristics of tunnel junctions formed on such surfaces. This has been deduced from measurements of the oxidation rate and the tunneling characteristics over a wide voltage range with the Nb in both normal and superconducting states. The improvement in characteristics resulting from the Al overlayer allows tunneling spectroscopy of Nb without having to allow for a proximity effect on the surface.}
