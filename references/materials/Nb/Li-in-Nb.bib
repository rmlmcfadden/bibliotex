	abstract = {Depth distribution of Li-6 implanted into niobium, and the alteration of these profiles by diffusion are measured through the energy spectra of α-particles emitted after 6Li(n, α)T reactions, Moreover, at high-temperature implantation, radiation damage profiles are detected through Li atoms which are found to be trapped at point defects. By studying channeling or blocking effects in the angular distribution of emitted t and α particles, the lattice location of Li atoms in niobium can also be obtained. The results of the present experiments are: (i) Range distributions agree in shape with theoretical predictions up to the third moment of the distribution, but absolute values of mean range, width, and skewness are about 23\% smaller than predicted by current theories. (ii) Rapid diffusion of interstitial Li is observed during implantation at 683°C, while trapped Li atoms still remain immobile. (iii) Damage distributions (presumably vacancy concentrations) agree with theoretical predictions up to the third moment, except for the same scale factor as found in the range distribution.}

	abstract = "The emission of light particles from exoenergetic (n,p), (n,t) or (n,$\alpha$) reactions can be used for detecting depth distributions and lattice positions of trace amounts of foreign atoms in crystalline samples. The advantages over p backscattering experiments are: (i) there occurs no background from the host lattice, (ii) thermal neutrons cause almost no radiation damage to the crystal, (iii) the method is particularly suitable for light atoms which are difficult to detect by other means. The method is demonstrated for low concentrations of 6Li and 10B in ionic crystals, semiconductors and metals. In some cases narrower blocking dips and lower minimum yields are observed than in other comparable blocking experiments. Range profiles of lithium incident on niobium and silver with an energy of 220 keV are measured, and are found to agree with the theoretically predicted Edgeworth expansion.",

	abstract = {The inelastic energy loss of light ions (Z1 = 1–10) has been measured for thin foils (Z2=6–79, d=500–800 Å), with a magnetic analyser. As a function of Z1 (nuclear charge of the ion) the cross section for electronic stopping Se exhibits a relative maximum at Z1 = 6 independent of the target material. As a function of Z2 (nuclear charge of the target) Se has maxima for the elements near the fourth group in the periodic table. As an application, the decrease in thickness of a bombarded foil is measured by the shift in energy loss of the sputtering ions.}

	abstract = {Only little information is hitherto available on the thermal mobility of lithium in metals and semiconductors. Therefore, we undertook a study on the thermal behavior of lithium, implanted into various solids, by means of the NDP technique. In the majority of cases, the Li mobility is strongly influenced by trapping at damage sites, which were either induced by the previous irradiation or preexisting in the target material. In those cases, a more or less complete transition from the regular range profile shape to the nuclear damage profile shape is observed. Finally, in several systems, regular thermal diffusion is found, which can be described well by Fick's law. Frequently, a fraction of the implanted Li is found to be much more mobile than the majority of the implanted material, which gives rise to surface precipitations at relatively low temperatures. The surface precipitations vanish when Li sublimation sets in.}
