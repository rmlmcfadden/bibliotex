	abstract = {Absolute magnetic penetration depths λ in evaporated Nb films have been measured as a function of residual resistivity ϱTc and temperature T by means of a refined two-junction junction interferometer technique. The measured λ(ϱTc) dependence is within the local London theory with ξ0=410Å and λL(0) = 440 Å, and the experimental λ(T) follows the empirical approximation λ(T) = λ(0)(1−T4T4c)12, where Tc = 9.0 K for a film with ρTc = 5.8 μΩcm. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test of λ(ρTc) in Nb.}

	abstract = {This study examines two parameters describing the electromagnetic properties of superconductors: the upper critical field Hc2 and the low-field penetration depth lambda . The current state of the theory for Hc2 is summarised and some new results for lambda are derived to focus on the dominant role of the Fermi surface topology and resultant anisotropies. These properties are evaluated for Nb and Nb3Sn as specific cases. Global parameters are found to be in good agreement with experimental data but other properties exhibit some scatter. The anisotropic deviations of the electromagnetic response are given to about 10\%. An estimate is obtained for the dependence of the penetration depth on the direction of the shielding current.}

	abstract = {The nonequilibrium state produced when a high energy (>1 keV) quanta interacts with a superconducting solid is the physical basis for many new detectors. The most common approaches magnetically monitor the phase of small “grains” (SGDs) or monitor transients in the quasiparticle tunneling current in voltage-biased Josephson junctions (TJDs). While the former requires transitions to the normal state for its signal, the latter's energy resolution is degraded by excursions in the order parameter. To facilitate detector design, this article quantifies how the choices of sample material, bath temperature and field bias combine to influence the magnitude and spatial extent of the thermal excursion. Extensive tables of materials parameters are included. A wide range of inherent effects including the magnetic field dependent latent heat of the transition are discussed in the context of the limitations they produce on the operating energy range and size of proposed SGD detectors. Superheated initial conditions are not considered because the need for automatic resetting in astrophysical X-ray spectroscopy. Of the 23 elemental superconductors, we show that as SGDs only 5 have maximum grain sizes larger than 10 μm and only 3 are usable for photons with energies above 100 keV. Alpha particle detectors will be restricted by conceptually equivalent physics. Only by using inhomogeneous initial states or local, rather than global, transitions may these restrictions on bolometric detectors be lessened.}
