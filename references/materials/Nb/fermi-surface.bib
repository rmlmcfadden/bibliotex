	abstract = {Part A is the first of two articles which summarize the present theoretical position on the electronic structure of pure metals. This first one lists the energy terms which control the behaviour of the solid, and divides them into groups according to their thermodynamic importance, and shows how the principal electrostatic interactions control the electronic behaviour of solids. Attention is given to this inter-electronic interaction and the way in which metallic screening of this interaction helps justify the use of band theory, based on non-interacting particles in a rigid lattice. A more detailed section describes band theory, and the stability of magnetic structures, and appendices outline some of the more important methods of solving the electronic band problem. Finally, a short section describes briefly the kind of modifications introduced by treating the interactions of the electrons with one another, and with other excitations, as perturbations. No attention is paid to the difficult problem of determination of the most stable crystal structures for each element. Part B describes the Fermi surfaces and physical properties of some of the real metals for which they are now known, and shows quantitatively the shortcomings of elementary band theory. Estimates of electron-phonon interaction effects, electron-electron exchange effects and interband magnetic effects are given where possible.},

	abstract = {We present an all-electron fully charge-self-consistent Korringa - Kohn - Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) study of the electronic structures of disordered bcc  alloys over the entire composition range. Specific computations are reported for x = 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0. Extensive comparisons with the predictions of the Nb-based rigid-band model (RBM) and other theoretical results, as well as with the relevant experimental results insofar as they are available are made. The particular issues that we focus on concern the evolution of the Fermi surface (FS), and the changes in the density of states and the superconducting transition temperature  of Nb with increasing Mo content. The N- and H-centred FS sheets of Nb are found to shrink essentially rigidly, but the -centred sheets evolve in a highly non-rigid-band manner. The x = 0.25 Mo alloy displays an especially large disorder-induced smearing of the -centred FS sheets. Direct experimental information concerning the FS is available only for the N-centred sheet via positron annihilation and in this regard our results are in accord with the measurements. Concerning superconductivity, we have computed the Hopfield parameters  and  for the Nb and Mo sites, and used the results to obtain  for  via the McMillan formula. We find that this simple scheme describes the observed composition dependence of  in  reasonably well.}

The results for Nb and NbSe 2 excellently reproduce both temperature and directional dependences of measured H c2 curves without any adjustable parameters, including a marked upward curvature of NbSe 2 near  T c . As for MgB 2 , a good fit is obtained for a π/σ gap ratio of ∼ 0.3, which is close to that from a first-principles strong-coupling theory [H. J. Choi et al : Nature 418 (2002) 758].

Complete phonon dispersions as a function of x  were obtained in good agreement with experimental data, independent of the approximation used for the exchange–correlation functional. For the Eliashberg function α2F(ω)  we found a shift of weight to higher frequencies as well as an overall reduction with increasing x up to x≈0.7; however, for x = 1 (pure Mo) the spectral weight for α2F(ω)  increased again. We used the information of α2F(ω)  to calculate and analyze the evolution of the average coupling strength λ(x) and the superconducting temperature Tc(x). The variation of λ(x)  closely follows the variation of the electronic density of states at EF. For Tc(x) experimental values were well reproduced provided a proper interpolation scheme for the Coulomb pseudopotential μ*(x)  was employed.}
