	abstract = {Part A is the first of two articles which summarize the present theoretical position on the electronic structure of pure metals. This first one lists the energy terms which control the behaviour of the solid, and divides them into groups according to their thermodynamic importance, and shows how the principal electrostatic interactions control the electronic behaviour of solids. Attention is given to this inter-electronic interaction and the way in which metallic screening of this interaction helps justify the use of band theory, based on non-interacting particles in a rigid lattice. A more detailed section describes band theory, and the stability of magnetic structures, and appendices outline some of the more important methods of solving the electronic band problem. Finally, a short section describes briefly the kind of modifications introduced by treating the interactions of the electrons with one another, and with other excitations, as perturbations. No attention is paid to the difficult problem of determination of the most stable crystal structures for each element. Part B describes the Fermi surfaces and physical properties of some of the real metals for which they are now known, and shows quantitatively the shortcomings of elementary band theory. Estimates of electron-phonon interaction effects, electron-electron exchange effects and interband magnetic effects are given where possible.},

At Nb − in distinction to other metals − CR signals are detectable only by certain additional requirements, as time of precooling or speed of magnetic field sweep. The results are interpreted on the basis of the Mattheiss model. Some pecularities of the spectrum are explained by a magnetic breakdown.},

	abstract = {Abstract Calculations of the extremal areas of Fermi surface orbits in the transition metal niobium (Nb) are presented using the ab initio linear muffin tin orbital method in the atomic sphere approximation and including the combined correction terms. Self-consistent calculations are performed using various exchange-correlation (XC) potentials. The Xα exchange-correlation potential (with α = 0.75) gives the best agreement with the experimental data. The anisotropy of the Fermi velocity of electrons at the Fermi surface and the mass enhancement factor are also calculated using this XC potential. These are compared with the experimental data and recent theoretical calculations.},

	abstract = { The three dimensional electron-positron momentum density in niobium has been reconstructed from measurements of two dimensional angular correlation of positron annihilation radiations (2D-ACAR) followed by the image reconstruction technique based on a direct Fourier transformation. We determined the position of the Fermi surface sheets; Γ-centered hole octahedron, multiply connected jungle-gym arms and N -centered hole ellipsoids. The Fermi surface topology is in good agreement with the theory. }
