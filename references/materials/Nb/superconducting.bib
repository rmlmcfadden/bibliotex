	abstract = {Accurate magnetization experiments on niobium (Γ > 2 000) from the superconducting transition temperature of 9·20(±0·03)°K to 1·5°K produced highly reversible curves. D.c. resistance measurements—yielding Hc3/Hc2 ratios of 3·4 to 3·65—suggest this to be partly due to poor surface finish. Temperature change altered the shape of the magnetization curves, which displayed a discontinuity in dM/dH at 1·005Hc1 and continuous non-linear approach to M = 0 at Hc2. Data were consistent with a λ-transition at Hc1. Thermodynamic critical fields Hc(t) obeyed the parabolic law, indicating strong coupling: 2ε(0) was 3·67(±0·05) kTc. Nearer Tc, the energy gap followed the BCS expression ε(t)/ε(0) = B1/2(1 − t)1/2 for B = 3·9(±0·2). Other parameters were ξ0 = 390(±15), λL(0) = 333(±15), S/St = 0·79, and κ0 = 0·815(±0·015). The Maki functions κ1(t), κ2(t) were in fair accord with theory, but changed rapidly with temperature, κ1(0)/κ(1) being 1·68, 30\% too high. This discrepancy is not explained in non-local corrections to GLAG theory. Temperature variation of Hc1/Hc differed from theoretical prediction.}

The multitude of different phases of vortex matter has thence proven to act as almost ideal model system for the study of both the underlying properties of superconductivity but also of general phenomena such as domain nucleation and morphology. Here we show how neutron grating interferometry yields detailed information on the vortex lattice and its domain structure in the intermediate mixed state of a type-II niobium superconductor. In particular, we identify the nucleation regions, how the intermediate mixed state expands, and where it finally evolves into the Shubnikov phase. Moreover, we complement the results obtained from neutron grating interferometry by small-angle neutron scattering that confirm the spatially resolved morphology found in the intermediate mixed state, and very small-angle neutron scattering that confirm the domain structure of the vortex lattice.",
