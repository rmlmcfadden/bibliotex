	abstract = {The results of an electrical resistivity study on various specimens are presented. High purity specimens were obtained by degassing under ultra-high vacuum. In particular, for the purest specimen: R273,15 °R20,25 ° = 213; this enabled accurate measurements to be made at low temperatures. Comparison between the specimens in the range of temperatures studied was carried out by using Matthiessen's rule at 77.35 °K and 273.15 °K, whereby the resistivity of a specimen of large diameter was used as a reference. Matthiessen's rule was verified from 63 °K to 300 °K. The results for the purest specimen are presented; these are lower than those found in the literature. For temperatures greater than 1500 °K, a pronounced curvature hitherto unreported was observed in the resistivity curve.}

	abstract = {Electrical resistivity measurements on niobium over the temperature range 20 K to the melting point published in a previous article1 have been analyzed. It is shown that Mott's theory is obeyed at high temperature in niobium. In particular, the resistivity curve reflects the variation of the density of states at the Fermi surface when the temperature is raised, thus demonstrating the predominance of s-d transitions. In addition, it is not possible to fit a Bloch-Grüneisen or Wilson relation to the experimental curve. Several arguments are advanced to indicate that even a rough approximation of the Debye temperature has no physical significance and that it is necessary to take the U process into account.}
