For samples of pure niobium nitride with different compositions the influence of the nitrogen content on the transition temperature to superconductivity has been investigated with the result of a transition temperature not exceeding 16.5 °K even for the stoichiometric composition NbN. This is in contrary to other authors. For diffusion wires of the systems (Nb-Ti)Nx, (Nb-Zr)Nxand (Nb-Ta)Nxthe critical temperature, lattice parameter and nitrogen content as a function of the admixture of titanium, zirconium and tantalum respectively, are given. For the first time the magnetisation curve of niobium nitride has been measured showing the behaviour of type II superconductors. Concerning the kinetics of formation of niobium nitride by diffusion the nitrogen content is increasing for constant nitrogen pressure with raising temperature of diffusion, but is decreasing in the high temperature region.",

In addition several pseudo-ternary systems and a pseudo-quaternary system based on niobium carbonitride have been investigated.

It is concluded that values of Tc > 18°K should be attainable in the pseudo-ternary system NbNNbCTiN. Several empirical correlations between transition temperatures and other simple physical quantities have been evaluated in terms of the new experimental data and shown to be only partially successful in systematizing interstitial compounds.

We believe that we have observed this transition. The value of Aslamazov-Larkin parameter obtained from the three-dimensional region (d/ξ 3) is about 13 the value computed from the normal sheet resistance of the film.

Such thin films have lower critical temperature (Tc) and higher resistivity than corresponding bulk materials. In an effort to improve them, we have investigated an effect of the AlN buffer layer between the film and the substrate (quartz or soda lime glass). The AlN film is deposited by DC magnetron sputtering, and the process condition is optimized so that the x-ray diffraction intensity from the 002 surface of wurtzite AlN becomes the highest. By use of this well-characterized buffer layer, Tc and the resistivity of the NbTiN film with a few nm thickness are remarkably increased and decreased, respectively, in comparison with those without the buffer layer. More importantly, the AlN buffer layer is found to be effective for NbN. With the AlN buffer layer, Tc is increased from 7.3 to 10.5 K for the 8 nm NbN film. The improvement of Tc and the resistivity originates from the good lattice matching between the 002 surface of AlN and the 111 surface of NbTiN or NbN, which results in better crystallization of the NbTiN or NbN film. This is further confirmed by the x-ray diffraction measurement.}

For the mass production of waveguide SIS mixer chips used in the receivers, we have tested two different compositions of  $\mbox{Nb}_{1-x}\mbox{Ti}_{x}\mbox{N} $ thin films for use in the mixer's superconductor low-loss transmission lines. These components are being fabricated for mass-produced waveguide SIS mixer chips in receivers. One composition was prepared by employing a sputtering target with 20 wt.% Ti and 80 wt.% Nb  $(x=0.2) $, and the other was prepared with a target composed of 30 wt.% Ti and 70 wt.% Nb  $(x=0.3) $. Both films are deposited using dc magnetron sputtering on quartz substrates. We found that the ratio between the superconducting energy gap and the critical temperature  $(2{\Delta}/{k}_\mathrm{B}{T}_\mathrm{C})$ of the Nb 0.8Ti 0.2N films is larger than that of the Nb 0.7Ti 0.3N films. Since we obtained better sensitivities in the SIS mixers using the Nb 0.8Ti 0.2N films, they were used to produce all the receivers. These showed excellent performance complying with the stringent ALMA specifications.},

We present a detailed comparison of optical properties for key representative materials in this class (NbN, NbTiN, TiN and MoSi) with texture varying from crystalline to amorphous. NbN, NbTiN and MoSi have been grown in an ultra-high vacuum sputter deposition system on silicon substrates at room temperature. Two different techniques (sputtering and atomic layer deposition) have been employed to deposit TiN. We have carried out variable angle ellipsometric measurements of optical properties from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths. We compare with high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of microstructure. Sputter-deposited TiN and MoSi have shown the highest optical absorption in the infrared wavelengths relative to NbN, NbTiN and ALD-deposited TiN. We have also modelled the performance of a semi-infinite metal air interface as a plasmonic structure with the above mentioned refractory metal based thin films as the plasmonic components. This study has implications for the design of next-generation superconducting nanowire single photon detectors and plasmonic nanostructure-based devices.},

By x-ray reflection (XRR) at a low angle and adopting a tri-oxidized-layer model to fit the XRR data, the thickness of each oxidized layer and the actual NbTiN layer below was obtained. This was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the NbTiN film indicated the presence of the oxidized layers Nb2O5, TiO2, and NbO on the surface. Besides, the analysis of the films gave consistent results for the oxidized layer with saturation values of approximately 1.3 ± 0.1 nm. We found that the thickness of oxidized layers remains unchanged under heat treatment of 200 °C. Our approach can help us further understand the surface properties of ultrathin NbTiN films for improving the performance of NbTiN-based devices.}

However, uncharted chemical spaces can be difficult to navigate, especially when materials synthesis is challenging. Nitrides represent one such space, where stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employ a suite of computational materials discovery and informatics tools to construct a large stability map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides. Our map clusters the ternary nitrides into chemical families with distinct stability and metastability, and highlights hundreds of promising new ternary nitride spaces for experimental investigation---from which we experimentally realized seven new Zn- and Mg-based ternary nitrides. By extracting the mixed metallicity, ionicity and covalency of solid-state bonding from the density functional theory (DFT)-computed electron density, we reveal the complex interplay between chemistry, composition and electronic structure in governing large-scale stability trends in ternary nitride materials.",

	abstract = {Inorganic nitrides are important technological materials, many of which belong to one of two families: hexagonal main-group metal nitride semiconductors and cubic transition-metal nitride superconductors (TMNs). This mixed experimental and theoretical study identifies a class of ternary MgxTM1−xN (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb) nitrides that bridge these families. While these materials have rocksalt-derived crystal structures similar to binary TMNs, electronically they exhibit semiconducting band structures, large dielectric constants, and disorder-tunable properties. Lattice matching with main-group nitride semiconductors along some crystallographic orientations, and full structural compatibility with superconducting TMNs make these materials uniquely poised for integration with established nitrides. Inorganic nitrides with wurtzite crystal structures are well-known semiconductors used in optical and electronic devices. In contrast, rocksalt-structured nitrides are known for their superconducting and refractory properties. Breaking this dichotomy, here we report ternary nitride semiconductors with rocksalt crystal structures, remarkable electronic properties, and the general chemical formula MgxTM1−xN (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb). Our experiments show that these materials form over a broad metal composition range, and that Mg-rich compositions are nondegenerate semiconductors with visible-range optical absorption onsets (1.8 to 2.1 eV) and up to 100 cm2 V−1⋅s−1 electron mobility for MgZrN2 grown on MgO substrates. Complementary ab initio calculations reveal that these materials have disorder-tunable optical absorption, large dielectric constants, and electronic bandgaps that are relatively insensitive to disorder. These ternary MgxTM1−xN semiconductors are also structurally compatible both with binary TMN superconductors and main-group nitride semiconductors along certain crystallographic orientations. Overall, these results highlight MgxTM1−xN as a class of materials combining the semiconducting properties of main-group wurtzite nitrides and rocksalt structure of superconducting transition-metal nitrides.}

This review summarizes the fundamental properties and structural chemistry of ternary nitrides, leveraging metastability and the impact of nitrogen chemical potential. A discussion of prevalent defects, both detrimental and beneficial, is followed by a survey of synthesis techniques and their interplay with metastability.

	% abstract = {We report the effect of nitrogen partial pressure on the growth of niobium-titanium nitride (NbTiN) thin films through reactive sputtering of the NbTi target in the presence of Ar and N2 atmosphere. The N2 partial pressure was varied from 5.8% to 15.15% with respect to the Ar flow available in the chamber. We measured a critical temperature (T C) as high as 15.77 K for an N2 partial pressure of 6.8% for a 50 nm film deposited on an MgO substrate. The epitaxial growth of the NbTiN films is evident from the observed (200) and (400) XRD peaks with respect to the substrate. The superconducting properties were analyzed with respect to the observed values of T C, ΔT C, temperature dependence of the upper critical field (B C2), coherence length (ξ), diffusion coefficient (D), and the thermally activated flux flow behavior following the Arrhenius equation. The T C variation observed for the entire spectrum of N2 partial pressure variation is ∼11%, with T C getting saturated towards the higher end of the N2 content. While the T C variation with respect to N2 content is non-linear, the variation of B C2(0), diffusion coefficient, and zero temperature coherence length ξ(0) show a linear dependence. While the B C2(0) values show an increasing trend, D and ξ(0) values show a decreasing trend with respect to the increase of N2 partial pressure. It is concluded that the optimum window of N2 partial pressure for the reactive sputtering of NbTiN using a target of Nb0.7Ti0.3 for the present experimental conditions, in terms of epitaxial growth and obtaining the highest T C is within the range of 5.8% to 8.51%.}

As a result, the film with parameters σ0 = 11·103 1/(Ohm·сm), λL = 280 nm, and Tc = 14.4 K were obtained. To fit the experimental data, two models with and without taking intragap states into account were used, and both of them are in good agreement with experiment.},
