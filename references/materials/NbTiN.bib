	abstract = {High pressure syntheses were performed in both binary systems of c-NbN/GaN and c-NbN/TiN under 3GPa at 1400°C. B1-type solid solution Nb1−xMxN was obtained only in a limited compositional range up to X=0.15 in case of M=Ga, but in a whole range of 0≤×≤1 for M=Ti. The lattice constants of both B1-type solid solutions decrease with increasing amount of additives. The Nb1−xGaxN solid solution exhibits a maximum Tc of 17.5K at X=0.05 where average number of valence electrons per atom NVE is 4.95 though the NVE value for maximum Tc in B1-type solid solution is normally 4.9 according to Matthias rule. Remarkable hystereses were observed in temperature dependences of diamagnetic susceptibility depending on Ga amount. Such hystereses were not observed in the Nb1−xTixN solid solutions. These results suggest that Ga atoms cause serious lattice distortion in B1-type Nb1−xGaxN(X<0.15) which can be prepared only under high pressure.}
