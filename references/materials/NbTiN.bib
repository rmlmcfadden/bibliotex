For samples of pure niobium nitride with different compositions the influence of the nitrogen content on the transition temperature to superconductivity has been investigated with the result of a transition temperature not exceeding 16.5 °K even for the stoichiometric composition NbN. This is in contrary to other authors. For diffusion wires of the systems (Nb-Ti)Nx, (Nb-Zr)Nxand (Nb-Ta)Nxthe critical temperature, lattice parameter and nitrogen content as a function of the admixture of titanium, zirconium and tantalum respectively, are given. For the first time the magnetisation curve of niobium nitride has been measured showing the behaviour of type II superconductors. Concerning the kinetics of formation of niobium nitride by diffusion the nitrogen content is increasing for constant nitrogen pressure with raising temperature of diffusion, but is decreasing in the high temperature region.",

The lattice constants of both B1-type solid solutions decrease with increasing amount of additives. The Nb1−xGaxN solid solution exhibits a maximum Tc of 17.5K at X=0.05 where average number of valence electrons per atom NVE is 4.95 though the NVE value for maximum Tc in B1-type solid solution is normally 4.9 according to Matthias rule. Remarkable hystereses were observed in temperature dependences of diamagnetic susceptibility depending on Ga amount. Such hystereses were not observed in the Nb1−xTixN solid solutions. These results suggest that Ga atoms cause serious lattice distortion in B1-type Nb1−xGaxN(X<0.15) which can be prepared only under high pressure.}

In reactions with nitrogen at 1273 K, alkaline earth metals (A) formed stoichiometric compounds of ANiN with nickel and A3MN3 with metals (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co). These compounds had [NiN]2− infinite linear chains and [MN3]6− trigonal planar units. Covalent nature was very important in understanding the bonding between M and N in these alkaline earth transition metal nitrides. The type of structural unit depended on the number of d-electrons. Rf-sputter deposition as well as high pressure synthesis was useful for preparing metastable transition metal nitrides and their solid solutions. (Ti1−xAlx)N solid solutions and a new compound FeN with zinc blende type structure were obtained by rf-sputtering.",

	abstract = {Thin superconducting NbTiN and NbN films with a few nm thickness are used in various device applications including in hot electron bolometer mixers. Such thin films have lower critical temperature (Tc) and higher resistivity than corresponding bulk materials. In an effort to improve them, we have investigated an effect of the AlN buffer layer between the film and the substrate (quartz or soda lime glass). The AlN film is deposited by DC magnetron sputtering, and the process condition is optimized so that the x-ray diffraction intensity from the 002 surface of wurtzite AlN becomes the highest. By use of this well-characterized buffer layer, Tc and the resistivity of the NbTiN film with a few nm thickness are remarkably increased and decreased, respectively, in comparison with those without the buffer layer. More importantly, the AlN buffer layer is found to be effective for NbN. With the AlN buffer layer, Tc is increased from 7.3 to 10.5 K for the 8 nm NbN film. The improvement of Tc and the resistivity originates from the good lattice matching between the 002 surface of AlN and the 111 surface of NbTiN or NbN, which results in better crystallization of the NbTiN or NbN film. This is further confirmed by the x-ray diffraction measurement.}

We present a detailed comparison of optical properties for key representative materials in this class (NbN, NbTiN, TiN and MoSi) with texture varying from crystalline to amorphous. NbN, NbTiN and MoSi have been grown in an ultra-high vacuum sputter deposition system on silicon substrates at room temperature. Two different techniques (sputtering and atomic layer deposition) have been employed to deposit TiN. We have carried out variable angle ellipsometric measurements of optical properties from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths. We compare with high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of microstructure. Sputter-deposited TiN and MoSi have shown the highest optical absorption in the infrared wavelengths relative to NbN, NbTiN and ALD-deposited TiN. We have also modelled the performance of a semi-infinite metal air interface as a plasmonic structure with the above mentioned refractory metal based thin films as the plasmonic components. This study has implications for the design of next-generation superconducting nanowire single photon detectors and plasmonic nanostructure-based devices.},

This was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the NbTiN film indicated the presence of the oxidized layers Nb2O5, TiO2, and NbO on the surface. Besides, the analysis of the films gave consistent results for the oxidized layer with saturation values of approximately 1.3 ± 0.1 nm. We found that the thickness of oxidized layers remains unchanged under heat treatment of 200 °C.

	abstract = "Exploratory synthesis in new chemical spaces is the essence of solid-state chemistry. However, uncharted chemical spaces can be difficult to navigate, especially when materials synthesis is challenging. Nitrides represent one such space, where stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employ a suite of computational materials discovery and informatics tools to construct a large stability map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides. Our map clusters the ternary nitrides into chemical families with distinct stability and metastability, and highlights hundreds of promising new ternary nitride spaces for experimental investigation---from which we experimentally realized seven new Zn- and Mg-based ternary nitrides. By extracting the mixed metallicity, ionicity and covalency of solid-state bonding from the density functional theory (DFT)-computed electron density, we reveal the complex interplay between chemistry, composition and electronic structure in governing large-scale stability trends in ternary nitride materials.",

	abstract = {Inorganic nitrides are important technological materials, many of which belong to one of two families: hexagonal main-group metal nitride semiconductors and cubic transition-metal nitride superconductors (TMNs). This mixed experimental and theoretical study identifies a class of ternary MgxTM1−xN (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb) nitrides that bridge these families. While these materials have rocksalt-derived crystal structures similar to binary TMNs, electronically they exhibit semiconducting band structures, large dielectric constants, and disorder-tunable properties. Lattice matching with main-group nitride semiconductors along some crystallographic orientations, and full structural compatibility with superconducting TMNs make these materials uniquely poised for integration with established nitrides. Inorganic nitrides with wurtzite crystal structures are well-known semiconductors used in optical and electronic devices. In contrast, rocksalt-structured nitrides are known for their superconducting and refractory properties. Breaking this dichotomy, here we report ternary nitride semiconductors with rocksalt crystal structures, remarkable electronic properties, and the general chemical formula MgxTM1−xN (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb). Our experiments show that these materials form over a broad metal composition range, and that Mg-rich compositions are nondegenerate semiconductors with visible-range optical absorption onsets (1.8 to 2.1 eV) and up to 100 cm2 V−1⋅s−1 electron mobility for MgZrN2 grown on MgO substrates. Complementary ab initio calculations reveal that these materials have disorder-tunable optical absorption, large dielectric constants, and electronic bandgaps that are relatively insensitive to disorder. These ternary MgxTM1−xN semiconductors are also structurally compatible both with binary TMN superconductors and main-group nitride semiconductors along certain crystallographic orientations. Overall, these results highlight MgxTM1−xN as a class of materials combining the semiconducting properties of main-group wurtzite nitrides and rocksalt structure of superconducting transition-metal nitrides.}

	abstract = {Interest in inorganic ternary nitride materials has grown rapidly over the past few decades, as their diverse chemistries and structures make them appealing for a variety of applications. Due to synthetic challenges posed by the stability of N2, the number of predicted nitride compounds dwarfs the number that has been synthesized, offering a breadth of opportunity for exploration. This review summarizes the fundamental properties and structural chemistry of ternary nitrides, leveraging metastability and the impact of nitrogen chemical potential. A discussion of prevalent defects, both detrimental and beneficial, is followed by a survey of synthesis techniques and their interplay with metastability. Throughout the review, we highlight applications (such as solid-state lighting, electrochemical energy storage, and electronic devices) in which ternary nitrides show particular promise.}
