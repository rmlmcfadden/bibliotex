The calculated BCS surface impedance of the films is also lower than for NbN. The overall properties of the (Nb1−xTix)N films are compared with those of other superconductors, and the suitability of this material for the production of superconducting sputter-coated copper cavities for particle physics accelerators is demonstrated.

B1-type solid solution Nb1−xMxN was obtained only in a limited compositional range up to X=0.15 in case of M=Ga, but in a whole range of 0≤×≤1 for M=Ti. The lattice constants of both B1-type solid solutions decrease with increasing amount of additives. The Nb1−xGaxN solid solution exhibits a maximum Tc of 17.5K at X=0.05 where average number of valence electrons per atom NVE is 4.95 though the NVE value for maximum Tc in B1-type solid solution is normally 4.9 according to Matthias rule. Remarkable hystereses were observed in temperature dependences of diamagnetic susceptibility depending on Ga amount. Such hystereses were not observed in the Nb1−xTixN solid solutions. These results suggest that Ga atoms cause serious lattice distortion in B1-type Nb1−xGaxN(X<0.15) which can be prepared only under high pressure.}

	abstract = {Thin superconducting NbTiN and NbN films with a few nm thickness are used in various device applications including in hot electron bolometer mixers. Such thin films have lower critical temperature (Tc) and higher resistivity than corresponding bulk materials. In an effort to improve them, we have investigated an effect of the AlN buffer layer between the film and the substrate (quartz or soda lime glass). The AlN film is deposited by DC magnetron sputtering, and the process condition is optimized so that the x-ray diffraction intensity from the 002 surface of wurtzite AlN becomes the highest. By use of this well-characterized buffer layer, Tc and the resistivity of the NbTiN film with a few nm thickness are remarkably increased and decreased, respectively, in comparison with those without the buffer layer. More importantly, the AlN buffer layer is found to be effective for NbN. With the AlN buffer layer, Tc is increased from 7.3 to 10.5 K for the 8 nm NbN film. The improvement of Tc and the resistivity originates from the good lattice matching between the 002 surface of AlN and the 111 surface of NbTiN or NbN, which results in better crystallization of the NbTiN or NbN film. This is further confirmed by the x-ray diffraction measurement.}

The NbTiN films deposited on MgO,  ${\rm Al}_{2}{\rm O}_{3}$, and fused quartz substrates showed excellent superconducting properties with a high $T_{\rm C}$ of 14.7 K, 14.5 K, 15.2 K, and low resistivity $\rho_{20\ {\rm K}}$ of 55  $\mu\Omega{\rm cm}$, 116  $\mu\Omega{\rm cm}$, 78  $\mu\Omega{\rm cm}$, respectively.

The lattice parameter systematically changed as ${\rm N}_{2}/({\rm Ar}+{\rm N}_{2})$ ratio was varied.

The hardness and Young's modulus increased, whereas electrical resistivity decreased with an increase in the Nb concentration in the films. The highest value of hardness and Young's modulus were 31 and 320 GPa, respectively, for x = 0.77, at which the value of the lowest resistivity of 56 $\mu$$\Omega$-cm was measured. The films showed a broad reflectance band, with a minimum in reflectance that shifted to shorter wavelengths as a function of increasing x. The reflectance band extended from the ultraviolet ({\~}250 nm) to the visible region ({\~}750 nm) and the position of the reflectance shifted from 2.33 to 3 eV with an increase in x from 0 to 0.77.",

	abstract = "Exploratory synthesis in new chemical spaces is the essence of solid-state chemistry. However, uncharted chemical spaces can be difficult to navigate, especially when materials synthesis is challenging. Nitrides represent one such space, where stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employ a suite of computational materials discovery and informatics tools to construct a large stability map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides. Our map clusters the ternary nitrides into chemical families with distinct stability and metastability, and highlights hundreds of promising new ternary nitride spaces for experimental investigation---from which we experimentally realized seven new Zn- and Mg-based ternary nitrides. By extracting the mixed metallicity, ionicity and covalency of solid-state bonding from the density functional theory (DFT)-computed electron density, we reveal the complex interplay between chemistry, composition and electronic structure in governing large-scale stability trends in ternary nitride materials.",
