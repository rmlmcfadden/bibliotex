   abstract = "Absorption transitions to vibrational levels close to the A state dissociation limit of ICI have been examined using a two-photon sequential absorption technique. The discrete rotational structures of I37 Cl bands to within 0.7 cm−1 of the limit have been selectively excited and analysed. A value of 17557.514 ± 0.030 cm−1 has been obtained for the I(2Po32) + Cl(2Po32) dissociation energy De, relative to the minimum of the ICI ground state potential well. The two-photon technique can be used to excite and display separately the high resolution absorption spectra of different isotopic species of a molecule which are contained in a mixture."

   abstract = "Two-photon high resolution sequential spectroscopy has been used to excite iodine monochloride from X1Σ+ ground state to the intermediate A3Π1 state and thence to a final electronic state at 4.82 eV. Vibrational and rotational analyses of this state have been carried out for both isotopic species. For I35Cl, Te = 38916.0 cm−1 ωe = 168.99 cm−1, ωexe = 0.357 cm−1 and Be = 0.05685 cm−1. The state probably has Ω = 1 in case (c) coupling approximation. It is also shown how to two-photon technique enables rotational line structure of the A ← X transition to be selectively excited for either isotopic species at a resolution of 500000, from an absorption mixture containing natural iodine monochloride plus its iodine dissociation product at equilibrium vapour pressure."
