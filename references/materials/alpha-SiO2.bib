On this hypothesis, the coefficient of self-diffusion of oxygen in quartz at 500° C. is found to be approximately 3×10-11 cm.2/sec. It is suggested also that diffusion of foreign univalent ions occurs mainly through vacant oxygen lattice positions. Experimental values are compared with those predicted by the theory of absolute reaction rates.}",

The samples were both 'as-received' and X-rayed, in the case of the lower-temperature measurements. The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of Al-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions. An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of Na + ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the beta -quartz-to-tridymite transition.}

The mineral is widely used as a raw material in several industrial applications. Because of its chemical composition (SiO2) and its specific properties, quartz can be used both as a bulk product (e.g. quartz sands in the glass or foundry industry) and as a high-tech material (e.g. piezo or optical quartz).Dependent on the specific conditions of either natural or synthetic formation, quartz can display typomorphic properties. Variations in crystal shape, specific micro-structure, trace element or isotope compositions, characteristic spectroscopic properties, etc. may be controlled by the genesis of the quartz involved. Accordingly, the defect structure of quartz is a fingerprint of its conditions of formation. A knowledge of the interrelation between quartz genesis and the specific properties developed at that time can be used both for the reconstruction of geological processes and for specific technical applications. Selected examples in the present study give an overview of how to analyse and use the specific information inherent in the mineral quartz.}",

These properties include: the open circuit voltage curve with respect to lithium metal, the elastic properties, and Li ion diffusion characteristics in SiO2 and Al2O3 and their lithiated compounds (such as Li4SiO4 and LiAlO2). Results show that lithiation occurs at the voltage above EC (Ethylene Carbonate) decomposition(∼0.8V) causing initial irreversible capacity loss. Also, lithiation softens Al2O3 mechanically, while slightly stiffens SiO2. For the Li ion diffusion, SiO2 and Al2O3 have totally different behavior upon lithiation. For SiO2, Li diffuses very fast, but the energy barrier becomes higher as lithiation goes on. When SiO2 is lithiated to Li4SiO4, the diffusion energy barrier becomes lower again. For Al2O3, its intrinsic ionic conductivity is very low, but the Li diffusion energy barrier becomes lower (as low as Li2Si2O5) as lithiation proceeds and LiAlO2 is formed. Therefore, designing ALD coating should target the coating properties after lithiation.},

In addition{,} we propose an ohmic electrolyte model to predict resistivities and overpotential contributions under battery operating conditions. For the crystalline materials considered we predict that Li+ diffuses quite slowly{,} with a migration barrier larger than 0.9 eV in all crystalline materials except [small alpha]-quartz SiO2{,} which is predicted to have a migration barrier of 0.276 eV along ?001?. These results suggest that the stable crystalline forms of these insulator materials{,} except for oriented [small alpha]-quartz SiO2{,} are not practical for conformal cathode coatings. Amorphous Al2O3 and AlF3 have higher Li+ diffusivities than their crystalline counterparts. Our predicted amorphous Al2O3 resistivity (1789 M[capital Omega] m) is close to the top of the range of the fitted resistivities extracted from previous experiments on nominal Al2O3 coatings (7.8 to 913 M[capital Omega] m) while our predicted amorphous AlF3 resistivity (114 M[capital Omega] m) is very close to the middle of the range. These comparisons support our framework for modeling and understanding the impact on overpotential of conformal coatings in terms of their fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties{,} and support that these materials can provide practical conformal coatings in their amorphous form."

Diffusion and modification of trace element content in quartz and its hosted melt inclusions have been investigated through step-heating experiments of both matrix-free quartz crystals and quartz crystals associated with sulfides and other minerals using a Linkam TS1500 stage. Magmatic and hydrothermal quartz were successively analyzed after each heating step for Cu, Al, and Ti using electron probe micro-analyzer. After the last heating step, quartz crystals and their hosted melt inclusions were analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and compared to unheated samples. Heated samples reveal modification of Cu, Li, Na, and B contents in quartz and modification of Cu, Li, Ag, and K concentrations in melt inclusions. Our results show that different mechanisms of Cu, Li, and Na incorporation occur in magmatic and hydrothermal quartz. Heated magmatic quartz records only small, up to a few ppm, enrichment in Cu and Na, mostly substituting for Li. By contrast, heated hydrothermal quartz shows enrichment up to several hundreds of ppm in Cu, Li, and Na, which substitute for originally present H. This study reveals that the composition of both quartz and its hosted melt inclusions may be significantly modified upon heating experiments, leading to erroneous quantification of elemental concentrations. In addition, each quartz crystal also becomes significantly enriched in Cu in the sub-surface layer during heating. We propose that sub-surface Cu enrichment is a direct indication of Cu diffusion in quartz externally sourced from both the surrounding sulfides as well as the copper pins belonging to the heating device. Our study shows that the chemical compositions of both heated quartz and its hosted inclusions must be interpreted with great caution to avoid misleading geological interpretations.",
