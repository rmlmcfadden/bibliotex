The dipolar fields produced by the uranium 5f-electron moments result in two magnetically inequivalent μ+ sites. Below Tc, the magnitude of the Knight shift is observed to decrease with decreasing T at one of the sites, whereas it is found to increase at the other site. The data is explained by an effective exchange interaction between the μ+ and the 5f-electrons which is temperature dependent and anisotropic below T≈6 K."

An anomalous change in the hyperfine coupling at low temperatures is observed which is similar to that reported in nuclear magnetic resonance studies of U- and Ce-based heavy fermion compounds. In the superconducting phase the static spin susceptibility, χspin, determined from the μ+-Knight shift decreases continuously with decreasing temperature in pure UBe13, but saturates below the second transition temperature in U0.965Th0.035Be13. We briefly discuss these behaviors in terms of a two-component spin-triplet order parameter and propose μSR experiments that can test our hypothesis."

The data are consistent with this two-fluid scaling law, with T*=8.9±0.4K, and are discussed in terms of the Sommerfeld coefficient and related changes in the low-temperature resistivity, specific heat and NMR relaxation rates in UBe13."

   journal = {New J. Phys.},
   abstract = {Heavy fermion (HF) compounds are well known for their unique properties, such as narrow bandwidths, loss of coherence in a metal, non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, unconventional superconductivity, huge magnetoresistance etc. While these materials have been known since the 1970s, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the fundamental mechanisms responsible for some of these features. Here we report transverse-field muon spin rotation (μ+SR) experiments on the canonical HF compound UBe13 in the temperature range from 0.025 to 300 K and in magnetic fields up to 7 T. The μ+SR spectra exhibit a sharp anomaly at 180 K. We present a simple explanation of the experimental findings identifying this anomaly with a gap in the spin excitation spectrum of f-electrons opening near 180 K. It is consistent with anomalies discovered in heat capacity, NMR and optical conductivity measurements of UBe13, as well as with the new resistivity data presented here. The proposed physical picture may explain several long-standing mysteries of UBe13 (as well as other HF systems).}
