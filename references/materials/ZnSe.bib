   abstract = "The Emission Channeling technique has been applied to probe the lattice sites of radioactive 8Li and 111mCd implanted in the wide band gap semiconductors ZnTe and ZnSe, and to study the annealing behaviour of radiation induced lattice damage. The probe ions were implanted at 60 keV energy into single crystal samples at the on-line isotope separator, ISOLDE, at CERN. On implantation at low temperature (⩽180 K) the Li atoms take up tetrahedral interstitial sites in both samples. A site change of the Li atoms from interstitial to substitutional takes place with increasing temperature. In ZnSe the substitutional fraction (fS) reaches its maximum value (55\%) at 275 K and maintains this value until 510 K; in ZnTe maximum fS (50\%) is reached at 250 K and maintained until 440 K. At higher temperatures the Li atoms diffuse to the surface in ZnTe and to extended defects within the crystal in ZnSe. Annealing studies with emission channeling measurements with 111mCd probes show that amorphization and lattice recovery depend strongly on sample and implantation dose."

   abstract = "The implantation sites and diffusion of Li in as-grown and Se-rich ZnSe has been studied with emission channeling measurements on the α-particles emitted in the decay of radioactive 8Li probes implanted in single-crystal samples. At implantation temperatures below 180 K the Li atoms are immobile at tetrahedral interstitial sites, but a site change sets in at 200 K, and above 250 K the Li atoms occupy mainly substitutional sites. In Se-rich ZnSe the interstitial Li fraction (fT) shows partial recovery between 260 and 360 K, a phenomenon which may be attributed to Li trapping at interstitial Se. Implantation dose, however, has a strong influence on the observed channeling and blocking patterns. Maximum fT is achieved at T⩾400 K where the fraction at interstitial sites is an order of magnitude lower. At higher temperatures (≈ 550 K) the Li atoms dissociate from their substitutional sites and diffuse to the surface in the Se-rich sample and to extended defects in the implantation region in the as-grown sample."
