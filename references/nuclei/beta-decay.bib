   abstract = "Complete expressions, with all Coulomb effects taken into account, are given for the distribution functions for allowed beta decay, including recoil, nuclear orientation, and electron polarization effects. The expressions are general in that no assumptions are made as to invariance with respect to space inversion, charge conjugation, or time reversal. Simple arguments based on the behaviour of the various momenta and angular momenta under space inversion and time reversal are used to elucidate which combinations of vectors will appear when the different symmetry laws are violated, and the modifications of these arguments necessary because of the Coulomb interaction in the final state are pointed out. Various tests of time reversal invariance, previously suggested, are re-evaluated in view of the results for the Coulomb corrections."

   abstract = "The status of tests of the standard electroweak model and of searches for new physics in allowed nuclear β decay and neutron decay is reviewed including both theoretical and experimental developments. The sensitivity and complementarity of recent and ongoing experiments are discussed with emphasis on their potential to look for new physics. Measurements are interpreted using a model-independent effective field theory approach enabling to recast the outcome of the analysis in many specific new physics models. Special attention is given to the connection that this approach establishes with high-energy physics. A new global fit of available β-decay data is performed incorporating, for the first time in a consistent way, superallowed 0+→0+ transitions, neutron decay and nuclear decays. The constraints on exotic scalar and tensor couplings involving left- or right-handed neutrinos are determined while a constraint on the pseudoscalar coupling from neutron decay data is obtained for the first time as well. The values of the vector and axial–vector couplings, which are associated within the standard model to Vud and gA respectively, are also updated. The ratio between the axial and vector couplings obtained from the fit under standard model assumptions is CA∕CV=−1.27510(66). The relevance of the various experimental inputs and error sources is critically discussed and the impact of ongoing measurements is studied. The complementarity of the obtained bounds with other low- and high-energy probes is presented including ongoing searches at the Large Hadron Collider."

   abstract = "Several searches for Beyond Standard Model physics rely on an accurate and highly precise theoretical description of the allowed β spectrum. Following recent theoretical advances, a C++ implementation of an analytical description of the allowed beta spectrum shape was constructed. It implements all known corrections required to give a theoretical description accurate to a few parts in 104. The remaining nuclear structure-sensitive input can optionally be calculated in an extreme single-particle approximation with a variety of nuclear potentials, or obtained through an interface with more state-of-the-art computations. Due to its relevance in modern neutrino physics, the corresponding (anti)neutrino spectra are readily available with appropriate radiative corrections. In the interest of user-friendliness, a graphical interface was developed in Python with a coupling to a variety of nuclear databases. We present several test cases and illustrate potential usage of the code. Our work can be used as the foundation for current and future high-precision experiments related to the beta decay process.

   Program summary
   Program Title: BSG Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/gx6yrpn22x.1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: C++ and Python Nature of problem: The theoretical allowed β spectrum contains a large variety of corrections from different areas of physics, each of which is important in certain energy ranges. A high precision description is required for new physics searches throughout the entire nuclear chart. Solution method: We implement the analytical corrections described in recent theoretical work. Nuclear matrix elements in allowed Gamow–Teller β decay are calculated in a spherical harmonic oscillator basis. Wave functions can be calculated in an extreme single-particle approximation using different nuclear potentials, or provided by the user as the output from more sophisticated routines. Corresponding neutrino spectra are calculated with appropriate radiative corrections. A graphical user interface written in Python additionally provides connections to a variety of nuclear databases.
