   abstract = "Nuclear spectroscopic information for the known nuclides of mass 31 (F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar) has been evaluated. A useful source of many of the Adopted Levels for 31P and 31S is presented in Endtʼs evaluations (1998En04,1990En08,1978En02,1973EnVA), however all the adopted properties of levels and gamma rays have been re-evaluated in this work. The data sets for reactions and decays, including all available gamma–ray data, are based mostly on the original literature. The 31Mg nuclide is a prime candidate for the study of ‘island-of-inversion’ as its ground state and first excited state can only be explained by intruder orbitals in a deformed shell-model approach. 31S is of importance in astrophysics rp-process as a possible ‘bottleneck’ nuclide. There are no data available for excited states in 31F, 31Ne and 31Ar. No gamma transitions are known in 31Cl. For 31Na, only one excited state is known. The radioactive decay characteristics of 31F and 31Ne isotopes have not yet been investigated. The 31S and 31Mg nuclei are currently being pursued intensively by various experimental groups, including recent work by Nuclear Astrophysics group at McMaster, the results of which will soon become available."
