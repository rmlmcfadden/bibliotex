    abstract = {Nuclear structure data pertaining to all nuclei with mass number A=93 (Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag) have been compiled and evaluated and incorporated into the ENSDF data file. This publication for A=93 supersedes the previous publication by C.M. Baglin, Nuclear Data Sheets 80, 1 (1997) (literature cutoff date November 1996) and subsequent revisions by C.M. Baglin of the ENSDF files for 93Br and 93Kr (literature cutoff 26 February 2001) and for 93Rh (literature cutoff 27 February 2001); it includes all data available prior to 15 December 2010. Significant changes since prior evaluations include the following: 2010Hw03 identified several high-spin states in 93Kr in 252Cf SF decay; in addition to the many low-spin levels already known in 93Rb from β− decay, several higher-spin states have now been identified in a 252Cf SF decay study (2009Hw03); this SF decay has also been used to identify additional states in 93Sr (2003Hw01) and the 238U(82Se,Xγ) reaction (2007Bu35) has provided new information on 93Y. (HI,xnγ) reaction studies have expanded our knowledge of the structure of 93Zr (2002Fo03, 2005Pa48), 93Nb (2007Wa45), 93Mo (2005Fu01), 93Tc (2003Ha22) and 93Pd (2004So04,2004Ru02). Considerable information on 93Nb was provided by a (p,2nγ) study (2010Or01, 2006Or09, 2007Or01). The level schemes of 93Ru, 93Rh and 93Pd have undergone the most extensive revision thanks to studies of 93Rh ε decay (2004De40), 94Ag εp decay (2004Mu30) and 94Ag p decay (2005Mu15, 2005Mu30), respectively. The half-life of the Zr member of this chain is of particular interest because of 93Zrʼs large contribution to long-term activity of nuclear reactor waste and also due to its potential as a supernova chronometer. During 2010, two new well-documented measurements of T1/2(93Zr) were published (2010Ya01 and 2010Ca01); one agrees well with an earlier, undocumented measurement but, unfortunately, the other is many standard deviations lower for reasons which are not immediately apparent.}
