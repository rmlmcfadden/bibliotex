   abstract = "A new method is described to determine the composition of exponential decay curves which are superpositions of an unknown number of exponential functions. An approach to solve this problem has been made by Gardner et al. 1), using Fourier transform techniques. But due to difficulties in the numerical calculation of Fourier integrals it was not possible to apply the method to real experimental data, though it was tried to improve the calculations, using fast Fourier transforms 2,3). In this paper the method of Gardner is developed further. The result is a formula, which does not contain any Fourier integral, by which it is possible to calculate the exponential composition of any given decay curve. The method is applied to several experimental examples."
