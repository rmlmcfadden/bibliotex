   abstract = "Polarized116In nuclei have been produced by capture of polarized thermal neutrons in several In compounds. At temperaturesT below 77 {\textdegree}K and magnetic field strengthsH0 of several kOe, asymmetries of a few percent of the $\beta$− decay of the116In ground state could be observed in polycrystalline InP, InAs and InSb, thus indicating the nuclear polarization. Nuclear magnetic resonance signals have been measured with the result for the magnetic moment $\mu$i(116In)=2.7723 (10) nm (uncorrected). $\beta$− decay asymmetry and spin lattice relaxation timeT1 have been studied as a function ofH0 andT. The effect ofH0 is to decouple the hyperfine interaction caused by the capture-$\gamma$ recoil process. However,H0 has no influence uponT1, which demonstrates the absence of nuclear relaxation due to paramagnetic impurities.T1 is determined by quadrupolar relaxation. A quadrupole momentQ(116In)=0.09 (2) b was calculated by comparison of the116In relaxation rates with those of the stable115In isotope in the same compounds. Above 30 {\textdegree}K the temperature dependence of 1/T1 agrees with a recent theoretical investigation. Below 30 {\textdegree}K the relaxation rate shows an anomalous behaviour, which can be explained by resonance modes due to recoil lattice defects.",

The depolarization process is studied by observation of the $\beta$ decay asymmetry as a function of magnetic field, temperature and of the radio frequency field strength in NMR signals. The depolarization is caused by a field dependent deorientation process and by temperature dependent spin-lattice relaxation. The deorientation is due to a succession of coupling steps of the nuclear spin with electromagnetic fields of defects generated as a consequence of the capture process, and the field dependence of the polarization can be understood as a decoupling curve. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation is in accordance with the theory of quadrupolar relaxation above 18 K if an empirical phonon spectrum is used for the calculation. At lower temperatures the experimental relaxation rate is anomalously high, which may be due to resonance modes connected with recoil lattice defects.",

The model assumes randomly distributed defect centres, typical of glasses, producing internal fluctuating fields. The only restrictive assumption is a power law for the distance dependence of the responsible interaction. In accordance with experiment, homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation, corresponding to exponential and non-exponential relaxation behaviour, is predicted in the cases of rapid and slow spin diffusion, respectively. Describing the fluctuating interactions by a BPP-type spectral density and assuming an Arrhenius law for the correlation time, explicit expressions for T-1− are obtained. It is shown that by comparison of homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation data information on the type of interaction and the density of defect centres can be obtained."

The diffusion-induced spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1diff was measured as a function of temperature from the melting point T m =454K down to about 1 / 2 T m and as a function of the magnetic field from 8 to 700 mT. 1/T 1diff can be explained assuming the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction alone. The data are analysed in the frame of the encounter model of correlated self-diffusion. The macroscopic self-diffusion coefficient D SD is determined over almost seven decades. A deviation from Arrhenius behaviour at elevated temperatures is interpreted in terms of a combined monovacancy/divacancy (1V/2V) mechanism. The correlation factor obtained from D SD and tracer self-diffusion coefficients D T , measured by mass spectroscopy, has a temperature dependence which is consistent with the 1V/2V model. The question of the possible existence of a non-classical isotope effect cannot be settled by a comparison of the present D SD values with those known from conventional nuclear magnetic resonance on 7 Li.}

For temperatures T<200K SLR is due to conduction electrons only, and the Korringa relation is found to hold in the concentration range covered. For T=200-450K, SLR is additionally influenced by atomic diffusion. The diffusional contribution consists of a dipolar part as in pure Li and a quadrupolar part induced by the solute ions. The analysis is based on the concept of two-exponential SLR for spin I=2. In Li-Mg the self-diffusion of Li and the diffusion of the solute ions are found to be slowed down on alloying. The ratio of the jump rates of Li and Mg appears to be determined simply by their atomic masses. In the case of the dilute alloy Li-1.6 at.\% Ag, which is amenable to theoretical diffusion models, comparison with tracer results favours an interstitial-vacancy pair mechanism. In the framework of this model Ag is found to diffuse faster than Li.}

The transient behaviour of the polarization of both nuclear species is characterized by and exp (−l/T1inh) law, which can be explained by inhomogeneous polarization averaging. The investigation of the temperature and magnetic-field dependence of the relaxation rate Ti inh−1 showed a lithium motion induced increase of the relaxation rate above room temperature. The value obtained for the apparent activation energy indicates partly localized lithium diffusion."

The temperature dependence of the corresponding relaxation rate T 1inh -1 shows two regions of different characteristics: below 200 K the coupling to relaxation centres typical of glasses dominates the relaxation. Above room temperature the relaxation of 8 Li and 12 B is due to Li diffusion in the glass.

Below T approximately=200 K the electric field gradients (EFG) at the two inequivalent Li lattice sites (Li(1), Li(2)) were determined. The spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) behavior above T approximately=300 K and the 8 Li NMR signals in the extreme narrowing regime (T>or=500 K) could be attributed to interlayer diffusion involving Li + jumps between Li(1) and Li(2) lattice sites ((1 to or from 2) jumps). In the temperature range 200 K<or=T<or=300 K the transients of the 8 Li(1) and 8 Li(2) polarizations were measured separately by applying a special radio frequency scheme. The different SLR behaviour allowed us to study the Li + intralayer diffusion confined to the Li 2 N layers. Furthermore, ultra-slow interlayer (1 to or from 2) jumps with correlation times of up to 10 s were observed in this T region. Below 200 K a nonexponential 8 Li polarization decay depending weakly on B and T was observed. The SLR in this T range is discussed in terms of statistically distributed relaxation centres.}

Common to both is the preparation of a highly nuclear spin-polarized atomic beam of 6Li in the one case and 8Li in the other. The latter isotope is radioactive and undergoes a $\beta$-decay with a half-life of 0.84 s. Li adsorbed on the close-packed Ru(001) surface is investigated. The longitudinal relaxation time, T1, is the main observable and is used to deduce the local electronic density of states [LDOS(EF,r=0)] and Li diffusion barriers. The second experiment uses 6Li as an adsorbate, also studied on Ru(001). The nuclear polarization is measured by beam foil spectroscopy. A novel particle detected (photon counting) Fourier transform NMR technique is demonstrated. This is done by observing the time-dependent flux of circularly polarized light emitted behind the foil after a 90{\textdegree} pulse has been employed at the surface. Electric field gradients and transverse relaxation times, T2, are thus determined. A large difference between T1 and T2 is traced to the dimensionality of the system.",

   abstract = "Adsorption, diffusion and desorption of lithium atoms on and from an Ru(001) surface have been investigated for various lithium coverages by β-decay-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR), by thermal desorption spectroscopy and by work function measurements. For low lithium coverages, β-NMR has been employed to measure the spin lattice relaxation rate between 200 and 1250K surface temperature. The local density of states at the Fermi energy (LDOS(EF)) extracted from these data at 800K surface temperature turns out to be coverage independent up to 0.15 of a monolayer. Thus, up to this coverage the adsorbate wave functions do not overlap. The extracted value of LDOS(EF)=(0.13±0.01)eV−1Å−3 agrees with recent theoretical predictions and excludes a complete ionic bond. Diffusion has been studied through observation of spin lattice relaxation rates for low coverages as a function of surface temperature between 200 and 1250K and at 200K, as a function of coverage, up to a full monolayer. The analysis of the data exhibits the existence of two distinctly different diffusion barriers on the surface, valued at 0.46 and 0.20eV. The former is attributed to jumps from step to terrace sites, whereas the latter is the barrier between adjacent terrace sites. The desorption energy of lithium atoms, deduced from thermal desorption spectroscopy data, decreases from 3.2eV at a coverage of 10−3 of a monolayer to about 2.5eV at percent coverages. This strong variation shows most likely the preferred population of defect sites at very low coverages."

At T=410K the signal is lost even though the center is still present. The activation energy for its reorientation in p-type Si is determined to be EA=0.53(2)eV."

It is not caused by hydrogen or other contaminations of the samples."

From the temperature-dependent amplitudes of high-resolution NMR spectra we conclude a gradual interstitial-to-substitutional site change between 200 and 350K. This is in accordance with earlier emission channeling results. We argue that this conversion proceeds via Lii++VZn2−→LiZn− and involves implantation related Zn vacancies."

It is independent of coverage below 0.2 monolayer (ML) and saturates at a twice as large plateau value beyond 1 ML. Calculations employing all electron density functional theory reproduce qualitatively the trend of the data. At low and high coverages, agreement between theory and experiment is almost quantitative. In addition, new terrace diffusion parameters for Li on Ru(001) have been obtained."

   abstract = "Li adsorption at extremely low coverages on the “metallic” Si(111)–(7×7) surface has been experimentally studied recently by β-NMR experiments. Instead of increasing linearly with the sample temperature, as expected for a metallic system, the relaxation rate α=1/T1 is almost constant in between 50K and 300K sample temperature and rises Arrhenius like above. In order to understand this behaviour in a transparent way a closed form analysis is presented using rectangular density of states distributions. The almost temperature independent relaxation rate below 300K points to an extremely localized and thus narrow band (width about 10meV) which pins the Fermi energy. Because of the steeply rising relaxation rate beyond 300K it is located energetically within a gap (about 380meV wide) in between a lower filled and an upper empty (Hubbard) band. In dynamical mean field theories based on Hubbard Hamiltonians this kind of density of states is typical for correlated electron systems close to a Mott–Hubbard metal–insulator transition."
