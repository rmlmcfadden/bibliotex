After production of the oriented probe nuclei interactions with surrounding fields cause their reorientation, which can be detected via a change of the anisotropy of the $\beta$-or $\gamma$-decay radiation. This has been applied to the study of internal magnetic fields, electric field gradients, internal motions and phenomena connected with production and annealing of radiation defects. Illustrative experiments in insulators, semiconductors, and metals are presented.",

   abstract = "This chapter surveys the behaviour of radioactive probe nuclei with lifetimes in the range of $\tau$N ≈ 10 −5 -- 103 s condensed matter. Not only hyperfine interactions (hfi) play a role in the experiments to be reported here, but all interactions of the probe's nuclear moments with electromagnetic fields. An important example is the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. In order to restrict the length of this review we consider only experiments where the probe nuclei have been created and oriented ``in-beam'', i.e., by reactions with a particle beam during the course of the measurement. Thus, the important area of low temperature nuclear orientation ($\tau$N ≳ 1 h) is omitted here, but this has been excellently treated in several recent reviews [6.1,2]. We discuss here all in-beam experiments using $\beta$ emitting nuclides ($\tau$N ≈ 10−2 -- 103 s) in condensed matter. Further, those in-beam experiments using isomeric $\gamma$ emitters are reviewed, where nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals were observed or where spin-lattice relaxation phenomena --- mostly in liquid metals --- were investigated ($\tau$N ≈ 10−5 -- 10−2 s)The many other experiments applying short-lived $\gamma$ active nuclei to solid state studies have been discussed in Chaps.4 and 5.",
