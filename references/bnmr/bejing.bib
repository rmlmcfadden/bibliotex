	abstract = {The β-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and β-NQR (nuclear quadrupole resonance) technique and its experimental set-up have been developed for the first time in China. The lifetime, magnetic moment and spin polarization of 12B were determined. The experimental results show the reliability of this newly developed β-NMR and β-NQR set-up.}
