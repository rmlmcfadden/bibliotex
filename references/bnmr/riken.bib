   abstract = "We have developed a device-control system of a β-NMR apparatus for the measurement of nuclear electromagnetic nuclear moments of rare isotopes. In this development, we installed fast relay switches into a high-power tank circuit in order to apply a strong oscillating magnetic field and to sweep its frequency as wide as possible. The system enables to conduct NMR frequency scans with wide frequency windows by dynamically changing the tank-circuit resonant frequency. Furthermore, logical electric-circuit modules of the data taking system were replaced by a programmable logic module. The system performance was evaluated in the β-NMR experiments conducted at the RIBF facility using 20F and 33Cl radioactive isotopes."
