	abstract = "NMR detected by radioactive beta decay, β-NMR, is undergoing a renaissance largely due to the availability of high intensity low energy beams of the most common probe ion, Li+8, and dedicated facilities for materials research. The radioactive detection scheme, combined with the low energy ion beam, enable depth resolved NMR measurements in crystals, thin films and multilayers on depth scales of 2–200nm. After a brief historical introduction, technical aspects of implanted-ion β-NMR are presented, followed by a review of recent applications to a wide range of solids."
