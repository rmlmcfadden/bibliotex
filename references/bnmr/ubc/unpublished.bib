   abstract = "We develop a general form for β time spectra under conditions that beam rate is time dependent. A particularly important case is identified when a long pulse of beam is delivered. The functional form of the average polarization is derived. The functional form of single histograms is also derived when a long pulse is delivered. The long pulse method is found to be superior to a short pulse method for measuring 1/T1 independent of whether the spin relaxation rate is fast or slow. The use of pulsed RF for measuring β-NMR resonances is also examined. There are many advantages, the most important being that systemtatic variations in the resonance signal are greatly reduced."

Origins of this background are considered. Understanding this background is important in determining its role in contaminating previous data, and also to aid in modifying the spectrometers to eliminate it. There are numerous early versions of this document floating around. This is the final one. I will not add or edit this one any further."

The point is to understand better multiexponential relaxation of 8 Li and be able to use it to calculate relaxation functions with the two inputs: 1) the initial state density matrix from the polarizer and 2) specific autocorrelation functions of the fluctuating quadrupolar interaction. Several such calculations exist in the literature[7, 8, 9], but none of these give a sufficiently detailed account for the above purpose. This is a pedantic, self-contained elaboration of the derivations in Refs. [5, 6] with additional detail, but aimed specifically at a quantitative account of quadrupolar relaxation for I = 2 in the solid state, with many of the details included to facilitate validation and as a thorough-ish illustration of the method."

I did a first iteration of this in Ref. [3], but here I will put in some more details. This is meant as an addendum to the document called “Quadrupolar Spin Relaxation for I = 2”, so you may want to look at that one first. It is similar in content to Slichter’s §5.12, page 206, but specific to spin 2. In Feb. 2018 I revisited this document to include new parts on the Moriya expression. In March 2018, I revised it to put it all in SI units, for ease of use."
