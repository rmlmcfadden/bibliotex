  abstract = "Low energy ion implantation of hyperpolarized radioactive magnetic resonance probes allows the NMR study of thin film heterostructures by enabling depth-resolved measurements on a nanometer lengthscale. By stopping the probe ions in a layer adjacent to a layer of interest, it is possible to study magnetic fields proximally. Here we show that, in the simplest case of a uniformly magnetized layer, this yields an unperturbed in situ frequency reference. We also discuss demagnetization contributions to measured shifts for this case. With a simple illustrative calculation, we show how a nonuniformly magnetized layer causes a strongly depth-dependent line broadening in an adjacent layer. We then give some experimental examples of resonance line broadening in heterostructures."

  abstract = {A β-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectrometer becomes a powerful tool to study changes in nuclear ground-state properties along isotopic chains when coupled to a laser excitation beamline to polarize the nuclei of interest. Recently, the β-NQR technique in a zero magnetic field has been applied for the first time to measure the ratio of static nuclear quadrupole moments of 8, 9 Li, Q 9 / Q 8 = 0.966 75(9) denoted by Q 8 for 8 Li and Q 9 for 9 Li, respectively. This shows agreement with present literature values but with significantly improved precision. Based on the literature, the quadrupole moment for 8 Li has been re-evaluated to be | Q 8 | = 32.6(5) mb. From this, the quadrupole moment for 9 Li is calculated as | Q 9 | = 31.5(5) mb with the error being dominated by the error of Q 8 .}

The precision on the ratio Q 11 / Q 9 = 1.0775(12) was improved by more than one order of magnitude and an absolute value for the quadrupole moment of 11 Li was inferred. Systematic effects, as argued here, are not expected to contribute to the ratio on this scale. The zero-field spin-lattice relaxation time for 8 Li implanted within SrTiO 3 at 295 K in zero-field was found to be T 1 = 1.73(2) s. A comparison of the quadrupole moments of 9, 11 Li and their ratio is made with the latest models, however, no conclusion may yet be drawn owing to the size of the theoretical uncertainties.}

  abstract  ="β-detected nuclear spin relaxation of 8Li+ has been used to probe the depth dependence of molecular dynamics in high- and low-molecular-weight deuterated polystyrene. The average nuclear spin–lattice relaxation rate{,} 1/Tavg1{,} is a measure of the spectral density of the polymer motion at the Larmor frequency (41 MHz at 6.55 T). In both samples{,} 1/Tavg1 is depth independent below ∼200 K but above this temperature it decreases approximately exponentially with distance from the free surface{,} returning to bulk behavior for depths greater than ∼10 nm. This is direct evidence for a region near the free surface with enhanced molecular dynamics compared with the bulk. The effective thickness of the surface region increases with increasing temperature and is finite even above the glass transition. These results present challenges for the current understanding of dynamics near the surface of polymer glas"

The activation energy for the γ-relaxation process is lower near the free surface. Annealing the PS-d8 films and then immersing in water to mimic the floating procedure used to transfer films had negligible effects on the thickness of the region near the free surface with enhanced mobility. Measurements on a bilayer film indicate enhanced phenyl ring dynamics near the buried interface compared with a single film at the same depth. PS-d8 films annealed with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) deposited on the surface show enhanced dynamics in the bulk compared with a pure PS-d8 film and a PS-d8 film where the SDS was washed away. There is less contrast between the surface and bulk in the SDS-treated sample{,} which could account for the elimination of the Tg confinement effect observed in films containing SDS [Chen and Torkelson{,} Polymer{,} 2016{,} 87{,} 226]."

The motional narrowing of the resonance and the local maxima in the SLR rate, 1/T1, imply sensitivity to subnanosecond Li+ solvation dynamics. From an analysis of 1/T1, we extract an activation energy EA = 74.8(1.5) meV and Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann constant TVFT = 165.8(0.9) K, in agreement with the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent. Near the melting point, the lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of the relaxation is nonexponential, reflective of our sensitivity to heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition. The depth resolution of this technique may later provide a unique means of studying nanoscale phenomena in ionic liquids.}

We observe stretched exponential spin lattice relaxation and a corresponding rate (1/T1) that increases monotonically above 200 K{,} consistent with the onset of ionic diffusion. A pronounced maximum in 1/T1 is observed at the low temperature magnetic transition near 20 K. Between these limits{,} 1/T1 exhibits a broad minimum with an anomalous absence of strong features in the vicinity of structural and magnetic transitions between 150 and 200 K.

Here, we demonstrate such a highly repeatable photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition in yttrium oxyhydride (YOxHy) epitaxial thin films. The temperature (T) dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ) of the films transforms from the insulating to the metallic state (dρ/dT > 0) under ultraviolet laser illumination. The YOxHy film recovers its original insulating state when heated (125 °C) under an Ar atmosphere and regains metallic conductivity when subsequently subjected to ultraviolet laser illumination again, showing a repeatable photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition. First-principles calculations show that the itinerant carriers originate from the variations in the charge states of the hydrogen atoms that occupy octahedral interstitial sites. This study indicates that tuning the site occupancy (octahedral/tetrahedral) of the hydrogen atoms exerts a significant effect on the photoresponse of metal hydrides.}
