   abstract = "A system to polarize nuclear beams in-flight has been built at the central beam line of the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) at the Cyclotron Research Center in Louvain-la-Neuve. Surface collisions at grazing incidence as well as the tilted foil method are being applied as polarizing techniques. These methods are generally applicable and overcome the limitations imposed by the low temperature in situ nuclear orientation technique. First polarization tests have been carried out with a 50 keV 14N+ ion beam: (i) transmitted through a 2 μg/cm2 tilted C-foil and (ii) scattered at about 2.5 ° from a flat Si(100) single crystal. The atomic polarization of the ions was detected by measuring the circular polarization of the 500 nm NII 2s22p3p3D2s22p3d3F° and the 567 nm NII 2s22p3s3P2s22p3p3D optical transitions. Values for S/I of 10.2(1.9)\% (500 nm) were deduced for the tilted foil and 7.7(1.1)\% (500 nm) and 6.9(1.7)\% (567 nm) for the scattering at the Si-surface."

   abstract = "A new β-NMR/β-NQR setup is developed to study nuclear magnetic dipole moments and electric quadrupole moments at the LISE fragment separator at GANIL. Two key elements make the new design very powerful: the homogeneous magnet and the strong radio-frequency amplifier. The combination of both makes it possible to examine a broad spectrum of magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Several factors have an influence on the detection efficiency and on the sensitivity of the setup to observe a resonant change in the β-asymmetry: the thickness and the tilting angle of the implantation crystal, the material in the vacuum chamber, the applied magnetic field and the Qβ-value of the decaying nuclei. A detailed study of these effects is made using a dedicated GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code."
