   abstract = "A study is made of the beta decay asymmetry of Li8, Ag108 and Ag110 nuclei produced in the capture of polarized thermal neutrons. The capture of thermal neutrons by Li7 nuclei is shown to occur mostly with the production of a spin 2− compound nucleus. The spin 1− compound states of Ag108 and Ag110 are found to play a notable role in the capture of thermal neutrons by Ag107 and Ag109 nuclei. An estimate is made of the relaxation time of Ag108 nuclear moments in AgCl at 6°K."

The process is controlled by the dipole-dipole interaction of nuclear magnetic moments with other nuclei (7Li, 19F) in the crystal. It is effective in a wide range of magnetic fields H0 = 150--3000 G as a result of a unique proximity of the g-factors of 8Li and 6Li nuclei: (g(8Li) − g(6Li))/g(6Li) = 0.0057. The kinetics of the 8Li depolarization is measured for an 6Li concentration of 0.15{\%}--10.06{\%} and in the field H0 of 200, 692 and 1210 G. A satisfactory explanation of the results is obtained on the basis of a numerical-analytical simulation of the process.",

The process is initiated by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. It consists in polarization transfer from a primarily polarized 8Li nucleus to the closest (stable) 6Li nuclei and in subsequent polarizationmigration over 6Li nuclei, the return of the polarization in question to the 8Li nucleus being possible. In order to obtain information about the polarization of 8Li nuclei, the asymmetry of beta radiation from them was measured with respect to the external magnetic field H0. The process was studied until it reached the diffusion asymptotic regime. The concentration of 6Li was varied between 3{\%} and 10{\%}, while the field strength H0 was changed from 200 to 1200 G. It is shown that microscopic theory is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results obtained in the way outlined above. A comparison with the investigation of the mathematically allied process of the F{\"o}rster electricdipole transfer of localized excitons is performed.",
