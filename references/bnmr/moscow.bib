The capture of thermal neutrons by Li7 nuclei is shown to occur mostly with the production of a spin 2− compound nucleus. The spin 1− compound states of Ag108 and Ag110 are found to play a notable role in the capture of thermal neutrons by Ag107 and Ag109 nuclei. An estimate is made of the relaxation time of Ag108 nuclear moments in AgCl at 6°K."

The process is initiated by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. It consists in polarization transfer from a primarily polarized 8Li nucleus to the closest (stable) 6Li nuclei and in subsequent polarizationmigration over 6Li nuclei, the return of the polarization in question to the 8Li nucleus being possible. In order to obtain information about the polarization of 8Li nuclei, the asymmetry of beta radiation from them was measured with respect to the external magnetic field H0. The process was studied until it reached the diffusion asymptotic regime. The concentration of 6Li was varied between 3{\%} and 10{\%}, while the field strength H0 was changed from 200 to 1200 G. It is shown that microscopic theory is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results obtained in the way outlined above.
