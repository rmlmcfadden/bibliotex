   abstract = "Tilted foil polarization and on-line mass separation have been successfully applied to a β-NMR technique for measuring nuclear moments. Nuclei are polarized using tilted carbon foils (multifoil array) and implanted in a catcher. Nuclear polarization, monitored by detection of anisotropic β-emission, is destroyed via resonant rf excitation to locate the NMR. Tests were performed using 12B (T12 = 20.4 ms, Iπ = 1+) and the ground-state magnetic moment of 33Cl(T12 = 2.51 s, Iπ = 32+) was measured using this arrangement. The 33Cl magnetic moment, corrected for diamagnetism, is μ = +0.7523(16) nm."
