   abstract = "In the stage-2 graphite intercalation compound LiC12 the spin-lattice relaxation rate T1−1 of β-active 8Li(T12 = 0.8s) nuclei was measured as a function of temperature T and external magnetic field B. Two regions of different T dependences were found. Below 100K the coupling to electrons dominates T1−1. Between 100K and 300K an additional contribution to T1−1 showed up which was found to be thermally activated. Long range Li-diffusion as relaxation mechanism could be ruled out due to the weak B dependence of the relaxation rate."

   abstract = "The method of beta-radiation detected NMR (β-NMR), complementing and extending the potential of conventional NMR, and its experimental realization by the new β-NMR spectrometer at the research reactor of KFA Jülich are described with respect to spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) studies. Recent applications to oxide and electrolyte glasses and a crystalline layered compound are reviewed. It is shown that a deviation from single-exponential SLR is a signature of local disorder in the vicinity of the β-NMR probes. The temperature and, especially, the magnetic field (or frequency) dependence of the SLR rate allow one to trace various dynamic processes, such as thermally activated excitations of disorder modes, anomalous ionic diffusion, molecular motions below and above the glass transition, and low-dimensional diffusion."

   abstract = "In a single crystal of β-Li0.525Al0.475 the method of β-radiation detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR) on the short-lived probe nucleus 8Li was employed. By investigation of the dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) rate on temperature T and external field B, two different diffusion-induced SLR mechanisms were traced. For T between 150 and 650 K Li diffusion is observed, below 150 K vacancy diffusion governs the SLR behaviour."
