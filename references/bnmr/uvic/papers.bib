	% abstract = {We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of thin-film N using 8Li β-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (β-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive 8Li+ probes were implanted ∼21 nm below the surface of a Nb0.75Ti0.25N(91 nm) film in Nb0.75Ti0.25N(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response recorded (via 8Li’s β-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a 4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional broadening below the film’s superconducting transition temperature  due to vortex lattice formation. Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth  and upper critical field , consistent with literature estimates. Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low temperatures, with dynamic (i.e. thermally activated) contributions dominating above ∼100 K. Below , we observe a small Hebel–Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap  and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our measurements suggest a gap ratio , consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic high-T relaxation are suggested.}
