The results lead to several intriguing findings concerning structures and interactions in unstable nuclei far from the stability line, such as a proton-halo structure in proton-rich nuclei, displacement of the single particle levels and quenching of the neutron effective charge in neutron-rich nuclei, and an anomalously large spin expectation value in a T=3/2 mirror pair. Applications of the present techniques to the study of hyperfine interactions of radioactive atoms introduced in solids are also discussed."

Two locations, site 1 and site 2, were found with the relative populations 9 and 1, respectively, and the electric field gradients (EFGs) at those sites were obtained to be q(site 1)=+(37.1{\textpm}0.5)1015 V/cm2, $\eta$(site 1)<0.03, q(site 2)=+(185{\textpm}5)1015 V/cm2 and $\eta$(site 2)=0.62{\textpm}0.02. We also found that about 30{\%} of the initial polarization of 8Li (I$\pi$=2+, T1/2=838 ms) was maintained in the crystal. Since the polarizations of other $\beta$ emitting nuclei, 12,16N, 13,19O, and 41Sc were also totally maintained in the crystal, the crystal can be a ``Spin Dewar'' in which many short-lived nuclides can be implanted with their polarizations totally maintained during their lifetimes for the studies not only on the electronic structure of impurities in it but also on the nuclear properties.",

Short-lived radioactive nucleus 12N(I=1, T1/2=11ms) was implanted into a single crystal of rutile TiO2 and its NMR was observed at 300–900K through the β-ray detection. Spin–lattice relaxation due to a fluctuation of the nuclear quadrupole interaction induced by an atomic motion was observed for oxygen substitutional and interstitial lattice sites. The corresponding amplitude of the fluctuation for the substitutional site was found to be much smaller than the static quadrupole field. From this result and the deduced activation energy, we infer that a substitutional 12N atom remains in the site and the observed spin–lattice relaxation is attributed to the motion of some kind of defects. The possibility of interstitial nitrogen diffusion is also discussed."

   abstract = "The $\beta$-ray detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) of a short lived-nucleus 17N (I ={\thinspace}1/2, T1/2 ={\thinspace}4.173 s) in liquid H2O and CH3NO2 has been performed. A $\pi$-pulse method was applied to obtain sharp NMR lines, from which the ratio of the Larmor frequencies of 17N in CH3NO2 and 1H was determined to be $\nu$[17N in CH3NO2]/$\nu$[1H2O]{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.1265751{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.0000019. Two resonance lines were observed for 17N in H2O with the relative frequency shifts of --(2.33{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.37) {\texttimes} 10−4 and (2.91{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.27) {\texttimes} 10−4 referenced to 17N in CH3NO2.",
