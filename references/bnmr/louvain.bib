   abstract = {Abstract Knight shift data of implanted 12B are used to estimate hyperfine field, Hhf(s), and Knight's ξ factor for Al, Cu, Ag, and Au metals at the boron site. In the Rh, Pd, and Pt transition metals the Knight shift and the Korringa relaxation time T1e are used to estimate the s and d terms of the hyperfine field. In addition to the data from the literature T1e is measured in Rh metal, and it is proved experimentally that in Rh, Pd, and Pt over T1e there is no other spin–lattice relaxation mechanism around room temperature. The hyperfine fields at the boron are compared with those at the muon (+) in these metals.},

   abstract = "We have measured the Korringa contribution T1e to the nuclear spin lattice relaxation time of the interstitial 12B in noble metals. The Korringa product of 12B shows that the conduction-electron spin susceptibility is exchange enhanced similarly to that sensed by the matrix nucleus. The enhancement factors are equal within the experimental errors for both interstitial and matrix positions in Cu and Ag. The small difference of the enhancement factors in Au can be attributed to a probe effect."

The boron decay asymmetry andrelaxation times were measured as a function of external magnetic field values andat different orientation angles of the crystal. To identify the resonances at certain field values in the12B depolarization in Al, a consistent theory based on the principle of a multi-spin system and Nuclear level-crossing has been developed. A unique identification of the resonances, based on the resonant interaction between boron andparticular pairs of aluminum neighbours, is perfectly possible. The strong dissipative coupling of the Al nuclei with the electron bath of the lattice hinders a straightforward interpretation of the resonance width anddepth.",
