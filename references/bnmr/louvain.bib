   abstract = "Polarized12B nuclei were produced andrecoil implanted in single crystals of fcc aluminum. The boron decay asymmetry andrelaxation times were measured as a function of external magnetic field values andat different orientation angles of the crystal. To identify the resonances at certain field values in the12B depolarization in Al, a consistent theory based on the principle of a multi-spin system and Nuclear level-crossing has been developed. A unique identification of the resonances, based on the resonant interaction between boron andparticular pairs of aluminum neighbours, is perfectly possible. The strong dissipative coupling of the Al nuclei with the electron bath of the lattice hinders a straightforward interpretation of the resonance width anddepth.",

   abstract = "We have remeasured the Korringa contributionT1e to the nuclear spin lattice relaxation time of the interstitial12B in nobel metals and in Al. TheT1eT times the squared Knight shiftK of12B taken from the literature, that is the Korringa product of12B, shows that the conduction-electron spin susceptibility is exchange enhanced similarly to that sensed by the matrix nucleus. The enhancement factors are equal within the experimental errors for both interstitial and matrix positions in Cu and Ag. The enhancement factors at the boron and at the matrix position are different in Au and Al.",
