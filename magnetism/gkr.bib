   abstract = "It is pointed out that trivalent cobalt with an octahedral co-ordination of oxygen ions has a low-spin and a high-spin state of comparable energy. The anomalous magnetic properties of the perovskite-type mixed crystals La1−xSrxCoO3−λ are interpreted in the light of this fact. It is assumed that the tetravalent cobalt ion is always in the low-spin state in this system. It is shown how the geometry of the perovskite-type lattice lends itself to the formation of two sublattices, each consisting of a set of (111) planes, in one of which the cobalt ions are predominantly in a high-spin state and in the other in a low-spin state. Experiments indicate that the magnetic interaction between trivalent cobalt ions in the high-spin state is antiferromagnetic, whereas the interaction between the low-spin tetravalent cobalt ions and the high-spin trivalent cobalt ions is ferromagnetic. These interactions are considered in relation to modified superexchange and the semicovalent-exchange models. The ferromagnetic Co3+−CoIV interaction permits a sharp distinction to be made between the two, although there is always some ambiguity in qualitative models. Further, the ferromagnetic interaction can be understood without recourse to Zener's double-exchange mechanism."

   abstract = "The relation between the symmetry of electron orbitals and superexchange interaction is discussed. It is shown that the sign of the superexchange interaction is closely connected with the cation orbital state, when the cation is subject to the crystalline field arising from octahedrally or tetrahedrally surrounding anions. In some cases, the sign of the superexchange interaction is definitely determined from the symmetry relations. The cases in which each cation is subject to an octahedral cubic field and the lines connecting the interacting cations to the intervening anion make an angle of either 180° or 90° are discussed in particular. Our discussion of the 180° case is applicable to crystals of the perovskite type and NaCl type and that of the 90° case to anhydrous chlorides. In the case where each cation is subject to a tetrahedral cubic field, there is a definite relation between the symmetry of the cation electron orbitals and superexchange interaction, if only the s-orbital of anion participates in the superexchange interaction. TiH2 is an example of this case. The interaction between nearest-neighbor cations in the crystal of the NaCl type is also discussed."
