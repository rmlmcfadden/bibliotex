   abstract = "The formalism for a Monte Carlo computer program which simulates slowing down and scattering of energetic ions in amorphous targets is presented. It was developed for determining ion range and damage distributions as well as angular and energy distributions of backscattered and transmitted ions. The computer program provides particularly high computer efficiency, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. This is achieved mainly by applying a new analytic formula for determining nuclear scattering angles based on the Moli√®re potential, and by suitably expanding the distance between collisions at high energies. With these improvements it becomes feasible for the first time to assess accurately both low and high energy problems with high precision using a single simulation program."

   abstract = "The Monte Carlo program TRIM SP was used to determine sputtering yields and angular and energy distributions of sputtered particles. The influence of the inelastic energy loss model on the sputtering yield is shown to be of great importance. Agreement of the calculated results with experimental data is reasonably good, even in very detailed analysis."

   abstract = "The Monte Carlo Program TRIM.SP (sputtering version of TRIM) was used to determine sputtering yields and energy and angular distributions of sputtered particles in physical (collisional) sputtering processes. The output is set up to distinguish between the contributions of primary and secondary knock-on atoms as caused by in- and outgoing incident ions, in order to get a better understanding of the sputtering mechanisms and to check on previous theoretical models. The influence of the interatomic potential and the inelastic energy loss model as well as the surface binding energy on the sputtering yield is investigated. Further results are sputtering yields versus incident energy and angle as well as total angular distributions of sputtered particles and energy distributions in specific solid angles for non-normal incidence. The calculated data are compared with experimental results as far as possible. From this comparison it turns out that the TRIM.SP is able to reproduce experimental results even in very special details of angular and energy distributions.",
