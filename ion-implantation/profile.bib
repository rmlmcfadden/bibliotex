   abstract = "A direct method for the determination of the depth profile of implanted polarized probes is described. It has been applied to measure the depth profile of 12B nuclei implanted at an atomic concentration of 10âˆ’16 in polycrystalline gold. The results prove the ability of this method to measure the depth distribution of implanted nuclei with an unknown energy distribution, which is typical for a polarized beam emerging from a succession of nuclear reactions or electromagnetic interactions."
