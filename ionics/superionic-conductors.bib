   abstract = {Superionic conductors are materials which exhibit exceptionally high ionic conductivity whilst in the solid state. The manner in which certain structures accommodate superionic conduction has preoccupied many scientists throughout the latter part of the last century, beginning with the early debate about the disordered structure of the superionic α-phase of silver iodide. In this review, the key methods that have been used to deduce structural disorder in superionic conductors are described, and the important results summarized. The review focuses on simple archetypal systems, since these have dominated the literature, concentrating on more recent work and including emerging methodologies for deducing structural disorder. In most cases, the interpretation of diffuse scattering, as observed in scattering measurements, has played a crucial role in the understanding of these highly disordered systems and this is considered in some detail.}

   abstract = {Superionic conductors are compounds that exhibit exceptionally high values of ionic conductivity within the solid state. Indeed, their conductivities often reach values of the order of 1 Ω −1  cm −1 , which are comparable to those observed in the molten state. Following Faraday's first observation of high ionic conductivity within the solids β-PbF 2 and Ag 2 S in 1836, a fundamental understanding of the nature of the superionic state has provided one of the major challenges in the field of condensed matter science. However, experimental and theoretical approaches to their study are often made difficult by the extensive dynamic structural disorder which characterizes superionic conduction and the inapplicability of many of the commonly used approximations in solid state physics. Nevertheless, a clearer picture of the nature of the superionic state at the ionic level has emerged within the past few decades. Many different techniques have contributed to these advances, but the most significant insights have been provided by neutron scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. This review will summarize the state of current knowledge concerning the crystal structures and conduction processes of superionic conductors, beginning with a comparison of the behaviour of two of the most widely studied binary compounds, AgI and β-PbF 2 . Each can be considered a parent of two larger families of highly conducting compounds which are related by either chemical or structural means. These include perovskite-structured oxides and Li + containing spinel-structured compounds, which have important commercial applications in fuel cells and lightweight batteries, respectively. In parallel with these discussions, the relative importance of factors such as bonding character and the properties of the mobile and immobile ions (charge, size, polarizability, etc) in promoting the extensive lattice disorder which characterizes superionic behaviour will be assessed and the possibilities for predicting a priori which compounds will display high ionic conductivity discussed.}

   abstract = "All-solid-state batteries with ceramic electrolytes and lithium metal anodes represent an attractive alternative to conventional ion battery systems. Conventional batteries still rely on flammable liquids as electronic insulators. Despite the great efforts reported over the last years, the optimum solid electrolyte has, however, not been found yet. One of the most important properties which decides whether a ceramic is useful to work as electrolyte is ionic transport. The various time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques might help characterize and select the most suitable candidates. Together with conductivity measurements it is possible to analyze ion dynamics on different length-scales, i.e., to differentiate between local, within-site hopping processes from long-range ion transport. The latter needs to be sufficiently fast in the ceramic, in the best case competing with that of liquid electrolytes. In addition to conductivity spectroscopy, NMR can help understand the relationship between local structure and dynamic parameters. Besides information on activation energies and jump rates the data also contain suggestions about the relevant elementary steps of ion hopping and, thus, diffusion pathways through the crystal lattice. Recent progress in characterizing ion dynamics in ceramic electrolytes by NMR relaxometry will be briefly reviewed. Focus is put on presently discussed solid electrolytes such as garnets, phosphates and sulfides, which have so far been studied in our lab.",
