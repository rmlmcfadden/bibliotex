   abstract = {Rechargeable batteries are found in a range of everyday devices, from shavers and laptops to cars and airplanes. Over time, these batteries can fail, either through a gradual loss of charge or through the inability to work under tough environmental conditions, leading to more catastrophic failures that cause fires or explosions. Palacin and de Guibert review such failures and suggest that, although often chemistry-specific, common causes can be found. They also look at ways to enhance battery lifetime, such as through improved battery management systems, which are needed for advanced rechargeable batteries.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.1253292BACKGROUNDWe are all familiar with the importance of mobile power sources (automobile batteries, cell phone batteries, etc.) and their seeming tendency to malfunction at just the wrong moment. All batteries show performance losses during their service lives that involve a progressive decrease in capacity (loss of autonomy) and increase in internal resistance, leading to voltage decay and loss of power. Battery aging phenomena evolve at substantially different rates depending on storage or usage conditions (temperature, charge/discharge rates, and voltage operation limits) and are specific to each battery chemistry. The study of the origin of such processes is important for battery calendar-life predictions, but this research is complex to carry out because it involves field trials as well as extrapolation from accelerated tests using suitable models.ADVANCESElectrification of automotive transportation and renewable energy integration constitute two imperative pathways toward reduction of gas emissions and global warming. These incur challenges in terms of energy storage technologies, for which batteries emerge as a versatile and efficient option. Durability is critical per se in such large-scale applications and also has a direct impact in terms of cost. As a result, efforts toward understanding the mechanisms of battery degradation have intensified in recent years.Aging and failure mechanisms result from various interrelated processes taking place at diverse time scales, hence their complete elucidation is a very challenging target. Battery operation upon each charge/discharge cycle should ideally only involve changes in the phases present at both electrodes and modification of their physical properties. However, all battery components can interact with one another to some extent, contributing to a convoluted system of interrelated physicochemical processes in which the influences of temperature and charge/discharge rate are decisive. Although interactions between the active materials and the electrolyte are largely responsible for aging upon storage, cycling generally damages electrode active materials{\textquoteright} reversibility because of the mechanical stresses induced by the structural changes taking place. Although both mechanisms are often considered as additive, interactions may occur and some additional factors (such as temperature) have an impact on both. Moreover, the variety of possible parasitic reactions is enhanced by the number of chemical elements present in the cell; this number is lowest for Pb/acid batteries (redox processes involve lead at both electrodes and current collectors are also made of lead) and highest for lithium-ion batteries, which can also comprise a larger variety of subtechnologies depending on the active materials used.Overall, the current available knowledge on these matters results from a vast combination of experimental and modeling approaches and has greatly benefited from the progressive improvement of available materials science characterization tools.OUTLOOKThe requirements for battery long-term stability are extremely stringent, and hence the advent of batteries with optimized calendar and cycle life will only be triggered by a full understanding of the ways in which the different systems fail. Thorough studies involving both testing and monitoring of real or model cells under different environments and/or postmortem studies using a wide range of experimental techniques coupled to modeling approaches are crucial to the complete elucidation of aging and failure mechanisms. Such knowledge is vital to developing reliable, realistic operation models, which in turn will synergistically contribute to the development of batteries with optimized calendar life. This is currently a research priority in the field that is expected to yield substantial progress in the years to come.Performance degradation is common to all battery technologies.Failure and gradual performance degradation (aging) are the result of complex interrelated phenomena that depend on battery chemistry, design, environment (temperature), and actual operation conditions (discharge rate, charge protocol, depth of discharge, etc.). Knowledge of such processes is crucial for the widespread deployment of large-scale battery applications such as transportation and the electric grid.Battery failure and gradual performance degradation (aging) are the result of complex interrelated phenomena that depend on battery chemistry, design, environment, and the actual operation conditions. The current available knowledge on these matters results from a vast combination of experimental and modeling approaches. We explore the state of the art with respect to materials as well as usage (temperature, charge/discharge rate, etc.) for lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel{\textendash}metal hydride, and lithium-ion chemistries. Battery diagnosis strategies and plausible developments related to large-scale battery applications are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Although overall battery performance is limited by the electrochemistry of the component materials, the actual performance can be limited by a number of factors. Zhu et al. review different electrode architectures for lithium-ion batteries. In particular, they look at the relations between the kinetics and dimensionality of the different electrode constituents. Making things smaller can improve transport of electrons and ions, but at the cost of making the overall architecture more complex. The authors discuss the overall design rules and criteria to guide battery design.Science, this issue p. eaao2808BACKGROUNDDeveloping high-performance, affordable, and durable batteries is one of the decisive technological tasks of our generation. Designing such batteries requires more than just the identification of electroactive storage materials with desirable properties such as high voltage, high capacity, and sufficient stability. These materials must also be assembled with ion- and electron-conducting phases into a composite electrode architecture, and this step is of equal significance; the size, shape, and spatial distribution of the various phases have a decisive influence on the charging and discharging rate capability of the electrode. Because the combined motion of ions and electrons within the solid is notoriously sluggish at room temperature, reduction of the transport length by downsizing the storage particles is indispensable. However, this necessity shifts the transport problems to the electrode{\textquoteright}s internal circuitry. That is, every electroactive particle must be part of a network that rapidly provides both ions from an electrolyte and electrons from an electronic current collector. If nanosized particles are used, then a myriad of particles and connections are required, resulting in a network with a degree of nanoscale intricacy comparable to that of electronic circuits in information technology or bioelectrochemical networks in living systems (see the figure). While electronic circuits are based on electron transport and bioelectrochemistry relies on ion motion, battery electrodes require a combination of electron-conducting, ion-conducting, and mixed-conducting phases.ADVANCESCriteria for rational electrode design are based on transport and dimensional parameters. The optimal size of the storage particles can be estimated from the chemical diffusivity and the (dis)charging rate needed in the application. An important strategy is to implement two different length scales over which ions and electrons must diffuse within the storage phase to reach the ionic (electrolyte) and electronic current collector phases. The optimal values of these two {\textquotedblleft}wiring lengths{\textquotedblright} depend on the ionic and electronic conductivities of the storage material. Nanoscale structures with different dimensionalities such as dots, fibers, and sheets are often useful for various reasons. If the current-collecting phases exhibit appreciable resistance due to tiny feature sizes, a hierarchical structure is helpful. Such considerations help to optimize the morphology and simplify the circuitry. They also provide a conceptual framework for organizing the vast literature on nanostructured battery materials and for reviewing characteristic topologies in a systematic way. To realize the targeted electrode architectures, substantial progress has been achieved by adapting various chemical and physical preparation methods. The figure shows lithium-storing tin particles embedded in a 2-μm-diameter carbon fiber prepared by electrospinning. Often a synthesized structure must deviate from the general design criteria to address material-specific stability issues such as interfacial reactivity, crack formation, agglomeration, and dendrite growth. Structural evolution during battery cycling is being elucidated by new methods based on x-ray absorption, electron microscopy, and other nondestructive probes that can provide in operando analysis at a variety of length scales.OUTLOOKMore powerful multiscale computational approaches are needed to adequately model the mixed-conducting electrode networks. Such numerical treatments will be helpful in optimizing electrode structures beyond the semiquantitative design rules reviewed here. The further development of synthetic methods is also vital, so that the desired complex and hierarchical architectures can be systematically reduced into practice. Whether or not even self-organized networks may be realized{\textemdash}as is the case in bioelectrochemical systems{\textemdash}remains to be seen. Finally, continued development of in operando characterization methods will surely boost our still-limited understanding of combined ion and electron transport in the presence of complicating factors such as mechanical strain, slow interfacial reactions, crystallographic anisotropy, phase transformations, and morphological instability.Battery electrodes, integrated electronic circuits, and bioelectrochemical networks all exhibiting intricate connections and nanoscale charge transport, although for different reasons.MICROGRAPH IS REPRODUCED FROM Y.

The diffusion timescale can be made faster by decreasing the size of the particles{,} but then it becomes more difficult to efficiently contact each particle with ionic and electronic current collectors{,} e.g.{,} electrolyte and carbon. To achieve an optimal balance{,} the dimensions of the various phases in the electrode architecture should be tuned to the transport properties of the storage phase. Here we quantify this strategy by modeling the kinetics of galvanostatic charging for several particle geometries using the Nernst–Planck formalism and assuming mass storage via a solid solution. We show that when ions and electrons are inserted at separate contact surfaces{,} in general the storage kinetics depend on two length scales – the ionic and electronic wiring lengths – that characterize the transport distances within the storage material to the respective current collectors. Quantitative guidelines for the optimal wiring lengths are derived for two model geometries{,} and the dependence on transport parameters{,} particle shape{,} and contact geometry is discussed. These results can guide the optimization of various aspects of the architecture of a battery electrode{,} including the size and shape of individual particles and the configuration of the electrolyte and current collector networks."
