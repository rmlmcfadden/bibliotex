   abstract = "An overview of the modified radiotracer based diffusion studies carried out at IGISOL is provided. The experimental procedures are briefly described followed by examples involving IGISOL as the key facility. In this respect the studies related to silicon-germanium (Si1{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}xGex) alloys and on the related diffusion systematics are summarized. Another group of examples is related to mobility determination of lead isotopes in glass for verifying retrospective radon measurements. Finally an outlook to future possibilities related to employing radiotracers in solid state research is provided.",
