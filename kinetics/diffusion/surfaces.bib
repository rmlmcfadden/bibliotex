   abstract = "The traditional view of the surface diffusion of metal atoms on metal surfaces was that atoms carry on a random walk between nearest-neighbor surface sites. Through field ion microscopic observations and molecular dynamics simulations this picture has been changed completely. Diffusion by an adatom exchanging with an atom of the substrate has been identified on fcc(110), and subsequently also on fcc(100) planes. At elevated temperatures, multiple events have been found by simulations in which an atom enters the lattice, and a lattice atom at some distance from the entry point pops out. Much at the same time the contribution of long jumps, spanning more than a nearest-neighbour distance, has been examined; their rates have been measured, and such transitions have been found to contribute significantly, at least on tungsten surfaces. As higher diffusion temperatures become accessible, additional jump processes can be expected to be revealed."

   abstract = {Catalytic reactions on surfaces occur at pressures at which the surfaces are completely covered with adsorbed molecules. It would seem that this arrangement would interfere with reactants encountering one another through diffusion processes. Hen{\ss} et al. used high-speed scanning tunneling microscopy to follow the diffusion of oxygen atoms on a ruthenium surface that was fully covered with carbon monoxide (CO) molecules (see the Perspective by Magnussen). Oxygen-atom diffusion was unexpectedly fast. A theoretical model revealed that CO diffusion appears to open pathways for oxygen-atom movement.Science, this issue p. 715; see also p. 695How particles can move on a catalyst surface that, under the conditions of an industrial process, is highly covered by adsorbates and where most adsorption sites are occupied has remained an open question. We have studied the diffusion of O atoms on a fully CO-covered Ru(0001) surface by means of high-speed/variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Atomically resolved trajectories show a surprisingly fast diffusion of the O atoms, almost as fast as on the clean surface. This finding can be explained by a {\textquotedblleft}door-opening{\textquotedblright} mechanism in which local density fluctuations in the CO layer intermittently create diffusion pathways on which the O atoms can move with low activation energy.},
