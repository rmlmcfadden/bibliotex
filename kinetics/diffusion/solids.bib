   abstract = "The movement of defects in solids on the basis of classical absolute rate theory is reexamined with special attention to many-body aspects. The effective frequency in the Arrhenius expression governing these processes is shown to be, in harmonic approximation, the ratio of the product of the N normal frequencies of the entire crystal at the starting point of a transition to the product of the N−1 normal frequencies of the crystal when it is constrained in a saddle point configuration. The influence of the masses of the various atoms on the effective frequency is investigated. It is shown that an effective mass which depends on the direction of the path through the saddle point in configuration space determines this frequency. In the case of chemical diffusion by the vacancy mechanism the effective mass is approximately the same as the mass of the solute atom, and must always lie between the mass of the solute and the mass of the solvent. It is finally shown that the classical rate theory, even with many-body considerations, is unable to explain the recent observations of Lazarus and Okkerse on the isotope effect in the diffusion of iron in silver."

   journal = {Rep. Prog. Phys.},
   abstract = {This article reviews the transport of atoms through crystalline solids under the influence of external electric fields, chemical and isotopic concentration gradients and thermal gradients. The main emphasis is on the statistical and thermodynamic description of these phenomena via the theory of mobile lattice imperfections - vacancies and interstitial atoms. In discussing the various phenomena in detail (§ 5) extensive use is made of non-equilibrium thermodynamics as providing a convenient general formalism. Particular attention is given wherever possible to the physical interpretation of the descriptions provided by this formalism. An introductory survey of the properties of vacancies and interstitials in relation to diffusion phenomena is given in § 2. This includes a summary of the various defect models applicable to different solids - metals, ionic solids, semiconductors and insulators. Section 3 deals in greater detail with certain necessary aspects of the statistical thermodynamics of solids containing defects. Section 4 briefly summarizes the basic theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, oriented towards matter transport in crystalline solids; attention is drawn to several pitfalls in this approach. Finally, § 5 is the main object of the review; it applies the material developed in §§ 3 and 4. This section deals with (i) isothermal diffusion in metal alloys, including chemical diffusion, and isotopic tracer diffusion, particular attention being given to dilute systems, (ii) electrolytic conductivity, ionic mobility and both solute and solvent diffusion in ionic solids, special attention being given to the relation between these quantities and to a generalized form of the Nernst-Einstein relation, (iii) the Soret effect and thermal diffusion, especially in metals and dilute alloys, and (iv) thermoelectric phenomena in ionic solids. The article does not deal with grain boundary or surface diffusion and does not specifically discuss diffusion-controlled chemical reactions, sintering or creep. Discussions of these aspects of the subject are given in the works listed in the bibliography.}

The interpretation of these data in terms of diffusion by monovacancies and divacancies has, in general, been successful and has provided information on the properties of these intrinsic defects. In the present review we first develop in some detail the equations that relate defect properties to measurable diffusion parameters for use in this and the following papers. Diffusion in selected pure metals is then reviewed. The potential errors inherent in relating high-temperature diffusion data over a limited temperature range to properties of monovacancies are demonstrated for a number of metals. The magnitude of the temperature dependence of defect properties is not well known, which increases our uncertainty in divacancy properties but has less effect on monovacancy properties deduced from tracer-diffusion measurements."

   abstract = {This review is concerned with the fundamentals of the theory of the transport of atoms through crystalline solids, such as may result from the existence of gradients of chemical and isotopic composition, electrical potential, stress, temperature, etc. The main emphasis is on the statistical description of these processes via the theory of mobile lattice imperfections-vacancies and interstitial atoms. Only processes taking place in the bulk of the solid are considered, i.e. enhanced diffusion and migration in the vicinity of dislocations, grain boundaries and other interfaces are not discussed. The various statistical theories available at the present time are reviewed against the phenomenological framework provided by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. One object of this work is to demonstrate the interrelations among the different theories and to disclose where they are equivalent. Another is to show that the means are now available to calculate all the phenomenological transport coefficients which arise in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of these processes in terms of the assumed properties of the defects, their interactions with solute atoms, etc. Although this review is thus primarily concerned with the theory of atomic transport at an abstract level, the physical aspects of the subject are referred to throughout. Explicit solutions of the transport equations, however, are not considered.}

non-metallic materials with average grain sizes typically in the range from 5 to 50
nm. The experimental methods applied are, on the one hand, tracer diffusion or
conductivity methods which are sensitive to macroscopic transport, and, on the
other hand, NMR techniques which, complementarily to the previous ones, give
access to microscopic diffusion parameters like atomic hopping rates and jump
barrier heights. In all cases the diffusion properties of the samples, whether
single-phase systems or composites, are dominated by their grain boundaries and
interfacial regions, respectively. In principle, all experimental techniques
allow one to discriminate between contributions to the diffusion from the
crystalline grains and those from the interfacial regions. Corresponding
examples are presented for SIMS and impedance measurements on oxygen
conductors. NMR studies for various nanocrystalline lithium ion conductors
reveal that two lithium species with different diffusivities are present.
Comparison with the coarse grained counterparts shows that the slower ions
are located inside the crystallites and the faster ones in the structurally
disordered interfacial regions. Investigations on composite materials exhibit
phenomena which can be explained by the percolation of fast diffusion
pathways being formed by the interfaces between the two components.}
