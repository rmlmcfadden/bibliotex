For Li2Ti3O7 the ionic conductivity is not sufficiently anisotropic to explain the observed small NMR prefactor in terms of i-D effects. For β-LiAlSiO4 the NMR line narrowing in the crossover region does not yield the predicted large change in the activation energy given by the 1-D theory."

   abstract = "The problem of modeling NMR correlation functions (cf) for ionic diffusion in solids is analyzed from a general point of view by summarizing the most useful mathematical properties of the cf's and by evaluating the merits of various approaches to the problem. While specific models of diffusion have been sometimes useful for interpreting data of well characterized samples there is, as yet, no generally accepted interpretation for quite similar relaxation behavior of the many different materials which have been studied. However, the NMR cf's,as well as the cf's appropriate for dielectric relaxation, photon correlation spectroscopy and mechanical relaxation experiments, are satisfactorily represented in terms of empirical fitting functions. For this reason, we discuss the physical meaning of the fitting parameter for the cf's which appear to have the Williams-Watts form, i.e., f(t) = exp(-(t/τ)β). This is done in terms of theories which take into account, from the outset, the disorderd nature of solids which support ionic conductivity."

   abstract = "Problems in relating the results of NMR relaxation time measurements to the results of bulk conductivity/diffusion studies for superionics have been discussed in a number of ways, such as their being a result of lack of knowledge of the appropriate motional correlation function. It is argued that, in the case of hydrated proton conductors at least, the problem is more fundamental. When previously unrecognized temperature-dependent correlation time spectra are present, these cannot be resolved in reduction of relaxation time data and information on any single contributory motion is not simply available."

   abstract = "Computer experiments have been performed to study the narrowing process of a Gaussian NMR line due to motions with temperature activated frequency components. A number of models are discussed which correspond to different choices of the correlation function describing the motion. In most cases, the data reduction procedures suggested in the literature do not yield appropriate values for the time scale and the activation energy of the motion. This inadequacy is the most likely cause of the so-called “prefactor anomalies” often observed in solid electrolytes. Simple rules are suggested for interpretation of NMR line-narrowing experiments in homogeneous systems where essentially all spins may be described by a single correlation function over the time scale accessed by the NMR experiment."
